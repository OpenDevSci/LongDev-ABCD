The in-text citations in my markdown file are currently included in the following format:

    "Here is some fake text and a citation @luciana2018; @thompson2019".

However, the `()` is unecessary as the citation formatter takes care of this. Therefore, I want to remove all instances of `()` in my document, but only if the first character after the `(` is an `@`, and it doesn't matter what the additional text between the `()` is.

   "Here is some fake text and a citation @luciana2018".

- See Github Projects page??
- Find Markdown, git/github, ide/vscode, quarto videos/tutorials
- use gpt to help create and organize tasklisks and such for the Projects Board
- Need to add info and link to the project within the readme and/or other files

Tasks for each example
- [ ] includes all correct headings, no incorrect headings
- [ ] runs on codespace with no errors
- [ ] formatting (e.g., tabs, panelsets are displayed correctly)
- [] add a "example structure" template with generic information included in each section, then update task list to "check off" that each of these sections is defined as "completed"
