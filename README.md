I am leading a collaborative open-source project for the Biostatistics Working Group of the large-scale longitudinal ABCD Study (https://abcdstudy.org/). The overarching goal of the project is to provide the field with a hub to facilitate longitudinal analysis learning and implementation. At present, the project is focused on two primary and overlapping goals. First is the development of an academic manuscript that provides a detailed overview of different types of longitudinal methods (see manuscript draft, attached). Second is the development of a basic website that contains code (primarily R code) that demonstrates longitudinal methods that can be used for their own purposes. To facilitate organization of this project I am building a Github Repository.
