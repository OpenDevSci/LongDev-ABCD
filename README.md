## About the Project

This repository is intended to serve as an open-source hub designed to foster collaboration, learning, and application of longitudinal analysis methods. This project, underpinned by data from the ABCD study, aims to bridge the gap between statistical methods and their practical implementation. A primary aim is to enable researchers and students alike to access, contribute to, and learn from a rich repository of knowledge and code.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Method Overviews**: Detailed explanations and comparisons of various longitudinal analysis methods.
- **R Code Snippets**: Ready-to-use code examples to help researchers apply methods to their own data.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Tools and guidelines for contributing to both the academic manuscript and codebase.
- **Educational Resources**: Guides, tutorials, and links to further readings for those new to longitudinal analysis.

## Getting Started
