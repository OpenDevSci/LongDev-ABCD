# MidFEMA Codespace Setup Guide 🚀

Welcome to the midFEMA Codespace setup guide! This document is designed to help you navigate and effectively use GitHub Codespaces for the midFEMA project, focusing on basic R analysis and Quarto for writing-ups. It's tailored for collaborators with minimal background in Codespaces, VS Code, IDEs, development containers, Docker environments, etc.

## Understanding Codespaces and Dev Containers 🧐

Before we jump into the setup, let's clarify what Codespaces and Dev Containers are and how they benefit your development workflow:

### Dev Containers 📦
Think of Dev Containers as VS Code running inside Docker. They allow you to define a development environment with a `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`, enabling you to run your project in that environment seamlessly—both locally and in the cloud.

### Codespaces ☁️
GitHub Codespaces are Dev Containers but hosted in the cloud. Accessed through VS Code, they use Dev Containers configurations to provide a powerful, cloud-based development environment.

### Working Together 🤝
The combination of VS Code, Dev Containers, and GitHub Codespaces allows you to develop from almost anywhere, on any machine. It's perfect for standardizing development setups across a team and handling multiple repo environments efficiently.

### Using the Codespace 🖥

- **Environment Ready**: The Codespace comes pre-configured for R analysis and Quarto, allowing you to dive straight into your work.
- **Seamless Development**: Start scripting in R or drafting in Quarto without worrying about setting up dependencies—they're all taken care of.

### Continuous Integration Workflows 🔄

Leverage Codespaces to streamline your continuous integration workflows, ensuring that your development environment closely mirrors production settings for more reliable testing.

## Development Container Configuration 🛠

This repository is equipped with a Development Container configuration suitable for both Dev Containers and GitHub Codespaces.

- **For Local Use**: Utilize the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command in VS Code for optimal performance.
- **Quick Start**: If you've got VS Code and Docker, [click here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/openresearchcollabs/midFEMA) to auto-setup everything. This process clones the repo, sets up the dev container, and gets you ready to code.
