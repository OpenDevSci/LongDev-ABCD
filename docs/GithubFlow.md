## Creating a Branch

Branches allow us to work on features, fixes, or other updates in isolation from the `main` branch, ensuring the main codebase remains stable.

- **For internal members**: Directly create a branch within the LongDev-ABCD repository.
- **For external contributors**: Create a branch in your fork of the repository.

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name

```

Tip: Choose a branch name that reflects the feature or fix you're working on.

## Adding Commits
Commits capture the state of your project at a point in time. Keep commits small and focused, with clear messages that explain the "what" and "why" of your changes.

```bash
git add <file(s)>
git commit -m "A descriptive message explaining the change"
```

Remember: Regular commits provide a clear history of your work and facilitate easier code review.

## Opening a Pull Request
Pull Requests (PRs) initiate discussion about your proposed changes. They are central to GitHub collaboration and a great way to get feedback.

Push your branch to GitHub.
Visit the [LongDev-ABCD repository](https://github.com/OpenDevSci/LongDev-ABCD) on GitHub.
Click "New pull request" and select your branch.
Provide a comprehensive description of your changes.

```bash
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

Tip: Link related issues in your PR description to automatically close them when the PR is merged.

## Discussing and Reviewing Changes
Once a PR is opened, team members will review your work. Stay engaged in the conversation:

Respond to comments and feedback.
Make any necessary revisions.
Update your PR based on discussions.
Remember: The goal is to improve the project and learn from each other.

## Deploying Changes
Our project automates deployments from the main branch. Once your PR is approved and merged, changes will be deployed to production.

Note: Keep an eye on the deployment process and be ready to address any post-deployment issues.

## Merging to Main
After successful review and deployment, your changes will be merged into main. We encourage deleting your feature branch post-merge to keep the repository tidy.

```bash
# Delete the branch locally
git branch -d feature-branch-name
# Delete the branch on GitHub
git push origin --delete feature-branch-name
```

Tip: Regularly sync your local main branch with the upstream repository to stay up-to-date.
