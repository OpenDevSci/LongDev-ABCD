## Contributing Code

### Creating a midFEMA Repository

1. Clone this repository into one that your account owns.
2. Commit to your repository first, then move code back to the project repository through pull requests.

### Getting Code into the Project Repository

Follow the pull request process for code review:
1. Make changes and commit to your repository.
2. Create a pull request into the project repository.
3. Assign reviewers.
4. Once approved, your changes will be merged.

### Composition of Pull Requests

Each pull request should focus on a single functional area to make reviews more manageable.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

All project members are expected to participate in the review process, providing thoughtful and constructive feedback.

## Reproducibility

We expect all contributors to maintain code that performs reproducible analyses, preferably automated. Scripts for analyses and figure generation should be included in source control.
