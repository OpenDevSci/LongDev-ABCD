<section id="introduction" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p> <a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" id="abcdwebsite" title="Visit the ABCD Study website">The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study®</a> is the largest long-term investigation of neurodevelopment and child health in the United States. Conceived and initiated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), this landmark prospective longitudinal study aims to transform our understanding of the genetic and environmental factors impacting neurodevelopment and their roles in behavioral and health outcomes across ten years of adolescence (Volkow et al.&nbsp;2018). At its heart, the study is designed to chart the course of human development across multiple interacting domains from late childhood to early adulthood and to identify factors that lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Central to achieving these goals is the commitment of the ABCD Study® and its NIH funders to an open science framework, intended to facilitate sharing of data and analytical methods, by espousing practices that increase access, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. In this sense, the ABCD Study is a collaboration with the larger research community.</p>
<p>The size and scope of the ABCD Study data allow the research community to perform a large variety of developmental analyses of both substantive and methodological interest, presenting a unique opportunity to significantly advance our understanding of how a multitude of biopsychosocial processes unfold across critical periods of development. In this paper, we describe models and methods for longitudinal analysis of ABCD Study data that can address these fundamental scientific aims, including: 1) characterization of the genetic and environmental factors associated with variation in developmental trajectories; 2) assessment of how the level and timing of exposures may impact subsequent neurodevelopment; 3) quantification of how variation in developmental domains may be associated with outcomes, including mediation models and reciprocal relationships. We instantiate these longitudinal analyses in worked examples using the ABCD Release 5.0 data with accompanying R scripts. Worked examples are available in Quarto files, accessible at <strong>XXXX</strong>.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-abcd-study-data"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The ABCD Study Data</h2>
<p>The ABCD Study enrolled a cohort of n=11,880 participants born between 2006-2008 and aged between 9-11 years at baseline, as well as their parents/guardians. The study sample was recruited from household populations in defined catchment areas for each of the 21 (originally 22) study sites across the United States. Information regarding funding agencies, recruitment sites, investigators, and project organization can be obtained at https://abcdstudy.org/. The ABCD Study design is described in more detail in <span class="citation" data-cites="garavan2018">(<a href="#ref-garavan2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>garavan2018?</strong></a>)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="dick2021">(<a href="#ref-dick2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>dick2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The ABCD Study is currently collecting longitudinal data on a rich variety of outcomes that will enable the construction of complex statistical models potentially incorporating factors from many domains. Each new wave of data collection provides another building block for characterizing developmental trajectories and implementing longitudinal analyses that allow researchers to characterize normative development, to identify variables that presage deviations from normative development, and to assess a range of variables associated with biopsychosocial outcomes of interest. These data include: 1) a neurocognitive battery <span class="citation" data-cites="luciana2018a thompson2019">(<a href="#ref-luciana2018a" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>luciana2018a?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-thompson2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>thompson2019?</strong></a>)</span>; 2) mental and physical health assessments <span class="citation" data-cites="barch2018">(<a href="#ref-barch2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>barch2018?</strong></a>)</span>; 3) measures of culture and environment <span class="citation" data-cites="gonzalez2021 zucker2018">(<a href="#ref-gonzalez2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>gonzalez2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-zucker2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>zucker2018?</strong></a>)</span>; 4) substance use <span class="citation" data-cites="lisdahl2021">(<a href="#ref-lisdahl2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>lisdahl2021?</strong></a>)</span>; 5) gender identity and sexual health <span class="citation" data-cites="potter2022">(<a href="#ref-potter2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>potter2022?</strong></a>)</span>; 6) biospecimens <span class="citation" data-cites="uban2018">(<a href="#ref-uban2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>uban2018?</strong></a>)</span>; 7) structural and functional brain imaging <span class="citation" data-cites="casey2018 hagler2019">(<a href="#ref-casey2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>casey2018?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hagler2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hagler2019?</strong></a>)</span>; 8) geolocation-based environmental exposure data <span class="citation" data-cites="fan2021">(<a href="#ref-fan2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>fan2021?</strong></a>)</span>; 9) wearables, and mobile technology <span class="citation" data-cites="bagot2018">(<a href="#ref-bagot2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bagot2018?</strong></a>)</span>; and 10) whole genome genotyping <span class="citation" data-cites="loughnan2020">(<a href="#ref-loughnan2020" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>loughnan2020?</strong></a>)</span>. Many of these measures are collected at in-person annual visits, with brain imaging collected at baseline and every other year going forward. A limited number of assessments are collected in semi-annual telephone interviews between in-person visits.</p>
<p>Data are publicly released roughly annually, currently through the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). By necessity, the study’s earliest data releases consisted primarily of one or two visits per participant. However, the most recent public release as of the writing of this paper (Release 5.0) contains data collected across five annual visits, including three brain imaging assessments (baseline, year 2 follow-up, and year 4 follow-up visits) for at least a subset of the cohort. Hence, starting with Release 5.0, it is feasible for researchers to begin focusing on the estimation of neurodevelopmental and other trajectories.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-concepts-and-considerations"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Basic Concepts and Considerations</h2>
<p>There are several important concepts to consider when conducting longitudinal analyses in a developmental context. These include different ways of thinking about developmental course, whether certain periods of development are relatively sensitive or insensitive to various types of insults or stressors, whether some time periods or situations inhibit the expression of individual differences due to extreme environmental pressures, and whether the same behavior manifested at different times represents the same or different phenomena.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case of developmentally-focused longitudinal research, each new measurement occasion not only provides a more extended portrait of the child’s life course but also brings with it greater methodological opportunities to make use of statistical models that distinguish within- from between-person effects and that loosen constraints that need to be imposed on the furtherance of critical scientific questions.</p>
<p>For example, collecting two or more within-person observations on the same construct at different times enables estimation of individual rates of change (slopes); more observations allow for more precise estimates of individual slopes, as well as characterization of non-linear development. Rate of change or other trajectory characteristics may be more informative about individuals than the simple snapshots of level differences that cross-sectional data are limited to informing. Cross-sectional age-related differences across individuals are poor substitutes for longitudinal trajectory estimates except under highly restrictive assumptions, e.g., parallel trajectories and lack of age cohort and experience effects <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson2011">(<a href="#ref-thompson2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>thompson2011?</strong></a>)</span>. Appreciation of these and other issues can help to guide the analysis and interpretation of data and aid translation to clinical and public health applications.</p>

<p>Adolescent development progresses normatively from less mature to more mature levels of functioning. However, unique epochs and experiences can alter the course of this idealized form of development. Consider research that shows cannabis use during adolescence is associated with later psychosis to a greater degree than cannabis use initiated later in development <span class="citation" data-cites="arseneault2002 bechtold2016 hasan2020 semple2005">(<a href="#ref-arseneault2002" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>arseneault2002?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-bechtold2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bechtold2016?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hasan2020" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hasan2020?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-semple2005" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>semple2005?</strong></a>)</span>; or similarly, experimental research on rodents that shows rodent brains to be especially sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on brain structure and learning early in development, corresponding to early adolescence in humans <span class="citation" data-cites="spear2016 crews2000 ji2018">(<a href="#ref-spear2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>spear2016?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-crews2000" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>crews2000?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-ji2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ji2018?</strong></a>)</span>. In another example, longitudinal data from the National Consortium on Alcohol in Adolescence (NCANDA) show that binge drinking is associated more strongly with decrements in gray matter volume early in adolescence compared to later <span class="citation" data-cites="infante2022">(<a href="#ref-infante2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>infante2022?</strong></a>)</span>. These examples highlight the importance of considering the role of vulnerable periods – e.g., temporal windows of rapid brain development or remodeling during which the effects of environmental stimuli on the developing brain may be particularly pronounced– when trying to establish an accurate understanding of the association between exposures and outcomes.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="developmental-disturbances."><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Developmental disturbances.</h3>
<p>Whereas vulnerable periods heighten neurobiological susceptibility to environmental influences, at other times, environmental exposures will tend to suppress stability and disrupt the orderly stochastic process of normative development <span class="citation" data-cites="schulenberg2019">(e.g., <a href="#ref-schulenberg2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>schulenberg2019?</strong></a>)</span>. This situation reflects a developmental disturbance in that the normal course of development is “altered” for a time by some time-limited process. In such cases, we might find that prediction of behavior in the period of the disturbance is reduced and/or, similarly, the behavior exhibited during the disturbance might have less predictive power with respect to distal outcomes compared to the behavior exhibited before and following the disrupted period. That is, once the environmental presses are removed (or the individual is removed from the environment), patterns of individual differences (and autoregressive effects) recover to levels similar to those prior to entering the environment. For example, in <span class="citation" data-cites="infante2022">(<a href="#ref-infante2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>infante2022?</strong></a>)</span>, recent binge drinking appears to be most predictive of gray matter volume trajectories, as opposed to more distal prior binge drinking or cumulative number of binge drinks, suggesting the potential for recovery of gray matter trajectories to prior levels of growth if binge drinking levels subside.</p>

<p>Normative development can also be upended by experiences (e.g., drug use) that, through various mechanisms, disrupt the normal flow of development wherein each stage establishes a platform for the next. For instance, substance use could lead to association with deviant peers, precluding opportunities for learning various adaptive skills and prosocial behaviors, in effect creating a “snare” that delays psychosocial development, such as maturing out of adolescent antisocial behavior <span class="citation" data-cites="moffitt2015">(<a href="#ref-moffitt2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>moffitt2015?</strong></a>)</span>. Relatedly, the consequences of these types of events can cascade (e.g., school dropout, involvement in the criminal justice system) so that the effects of the snare are amplified <span class="citation" data-cites="masten2005 rogosch2010">(e.g., <a href="#ref-masten2005" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>masten2005?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-rogosch2010" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>rogosch2010?</strong></a>)</span>. Although conceptually distinct from vulnerable periods, both types of developmental considerations highlight the importance of viewing behavior in the context of development and attempting to determine how various developmental pathways unfold. Longitudinal data are crucial in this context to assess individual levels of development prior to and following onset of experiences or other environmental factors; e.g., the ABCD Study collected data starting at ages 9-10 and hence before the onset of substance use for the vast majority of participants.</p>

<p>The hallmark characteristic of longitudinal data analysis is the administration of repeated measurements of the same constructs on assessment targets (e.g., individuals, families) across time. The primary rationale for collecting longitudinal data is to assess within-person change over time, allowing researchers to estimate individual developmental trajectories and the genetic and/or environmental factors that may impact these trajectories. Administering repeated measurements more frequently or over longer time spans enables researchers to ask more nuanced questions and to make stronger inferences.</p>
<section id="two-time-points-versus-three-or-more." class="level3" data-number="3.1.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="two-time-points-versus-three-or-more."><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Two Time Points versus Three or More.</h3>
<p>Although the clear leap from cross-sectional to the realm of longitudinal data involves going from one assessment to two or more assessments, there are also notable distinctions in designs based on two-assessment points versus three or more measurement occasions. Just as cross-sectional data can be informative in some situations, two waves of data can be beneficial in contexts such as when experimental manipulation is involved (e.g., pre/post tests), or if the central goal is prediction (e.g., trying to predict scores on Variable A at time T as a function of prior scores on Variable A and Variable B at time T-1). At the same time, data based on two assessments are inherently limited on multiple fronts. As <span class="citation" data-cites="rogosa1982">(<a href="#ref-rogosa1982" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>rogosa1982?</strong></a>)</span> noted over forty years ago, “Two waves of data are better than one, but maybe not much better” (p.&nbsp;744).</p>
<p>These sentiments are reflected in more contemporary recommendations regarding best-practice guidelines for prospective data, which increasingly emphasize the benefits of additional measurement occasions for trajectory estimation, model identification and accurate parameter inferences. It is also consistent with research recommending that developmental studies include three or more assessment points, given it is impossible for data based on two-time points to determine the shape of development (given that linear change is the only estimable form for two assessments waves; <span class="citation" data-cites="duncan2009">(see <a href="#ref-duncan2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>duncan2009?</strong></a>)</span>). Research designs that include three (but preferably more) time points allow for non-linear trajectory estimation and increasingly nuanced analyses that more adequately tease apart sources of variation and covariation among the repeated assessments <span class="citation" data-cites="king2018">(<a href="#ref-king2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>king2018?</strong></a>)</span>– a key aspect of developmental research.</p>
<p>To illustrate, developmental theories are useful for understanding patterns of within-individual change over time (discussed in further detail, below); however, two data points provide meager information on change at the person level. This point is further underscored in a recent review of statistical models commonly touted as distinguishing within-individual vs between-individual sources of variance in which the study authors concluded “… researchers are limited when attempting to differentiate these sources of variation in psychological phenomenon when using two waves of data” and perhaps more concerning, “…the models discussed here do not offer a feasible way to overcome these inherent limitations” <span class="citation" data-cites="littlefield2021">(<a href="#ref-littlefield2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2021?</strong></a>)</span>. It is important to note, however, that despite the current focus on two-wave designs versus three or more assessment waves, garnering three assessment points is not a panacea for longitudinal modeling. Indeed, several contemporary longitudinal models designed to isolate within-individual variability (e.g., the Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals; <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2014">(<a href="#ref-curran2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2014?</strong></a>)</span>) require at least four assessments to parameterize fully and, more generally, increasingly accurate and nuanced parameter estimates are obtained as more assessment occasions are used <span class="citation" data-cites="duncan2009">(<a href="#ref-duncan2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>duncan2009?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-stability-and-change"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Types of stability and change</h3>
<p>If one were to try to sum up what developmental trajectories in a living organism are exactly, one could plausibly argue they are the patterns of stability and change in its phenotypes as the organism traverses the life course. Symbolically, developmental trajectories can be expressed as fi(t), a possibly multivariate function of time t, specific to the ith individual and typically taking values in the real numbers for continuous phenotypes and the integers for discrete phenotypes. Ideally, t is a biologically meaningful temporal index (e.g., calendar age) as opposed to an exogenous progression of events (e.g., study visit number). Properties of interest might include rate of change over time, degree of smoothness (e.g., continuously differentiable), shape (e.g., polynomial or asymptotic behavior), how and how much fi(t) differs across individuals, and what factors predict either within-individual variation (at different times) or between-individual variation (either overall or at specific times).</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to think about patterns of stability and change (see Figure 1). Consider measuring school disengagement at the start of middle school and the end of middle school . A common first step may be to compare sixth graders’ average disengagement values and eighth graders’ disengagement values. This comparison of the average scores for the same group of individuals at multiple time points is referred to as “mean-level”, as it provides information about change over time (or lack thereof) for an outcome of interest aggregated across members of a group. In contrast, “between-individual” stability could be assessed, e.g., by calculating the Spearman correlation between the values obtained at different time points (e.g., ‘disengagement in sixth grade’ with ’disengagement in eighth grade). This analysis focuses on the degree to which individuals retain their relative placement in a group across time. Consider someone who reported the lowest frequencies of disengagement in 6th grade and may report significantly higher disengagement over middle school (i.e., exhibit high levels of change), but report the lowest frequencies of disengagement in eighth grade. That is, the individual is manifesting rank-order stability, even in the context of high mean-level change.</p>
<p>Both types of stability and change are important. Mean-level change in certain traits might help to explain why, in general, populations of individuals tend to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental factors in specific age ranges; rank-order stability might help to quantify the extent to which certain characteristics of the individual are more or less trait-like compared to others. For example, in some areas of development, considerable mean-level change occurs over time (e.g., changes in Big 5 personality traits; <span class="citation" data-cites="bleidorn2022">(<a href="#ref-bleidorn2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bleidorn2022?</strong></a>)</span>), but exhibit relatively high rank-order stability, at least over shorter measurement intervals <span class="citation" data-cites="bleidorn2022 roberts2000 roberts2006">(<a href="#ref-bleidorn2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bleidorn2022?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-roberts2000" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>roberts2000?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-roberts2006" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>roberts2006?</strong></a>)</span>. Despite the useful information afforded by examining mean-level and rank-order stability and change, these approaches are limited in that they provide little information about the overall patterns of within-individual change (i.e., trajectories) and, in turn, can result in fundamental misinterpretations about substantial or meaningful changes in an outcome of interest <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2011">(<a href="#ref-curran2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2011?</strong></a>)</span>. For example, questions related to the impact of early-onset substance use on brain development focus on changes within a given individual (i.e., intraindividual differences). The longitudinal nature of the ABCD Study, which will provide researchers with over ten time points for some constructs (e.g., substance use) across a ten-year period, allows for the study of within-person processes.</p>

<p>There is growing recognition that statistical models commonly applied to longitudinal data often fail to align with the developmental theory they are being used to assess <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2011 hoffman2015 littlefield2021">(e.g., <a href="#ref-curran2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2011?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hoffman2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hoffman2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-littlefield2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2021?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>First, developmental studies typically involve the use of prospective data to inform theories that are concerned with clear within-person processes (e.g., how phenotypes change or remain stable within individuals over time, <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2011">(e.g., <a href="#ref-curran2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2011?</strong></a>)</span>). Despite this, methods generally unsuited for disaggregating between- and within-person effects (e.g., cross-lagged panel models [CLPM]) remain common within various extant literatures. Fortunately, there exists a range of models that have been proposed to tease apart between- and within-person sources of variance across time <span class="citation" data-cites="littlefield2021 orth2021">(see <a href="#ref-littlefield2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2021?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-orth2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>orth2021?</strong></a>)</span>. Most of these contemporary alternatives incorporate time-specific latent variables to capture between-person sources of variance and model within-person deviations around an individual’s mean (or trait) level across time (e.g., random-intercept cross-lagged panel model [RI-CLPM], <span class="citation" data-cites="hamaker2015">(<a href="#ref-hamaker2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hamaker2015?</strong></a>)</span>; latent curve models with structured residuals [LCM-SR], <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2014">(<a href="#ref-curran2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2014?</strong></a>)</span>). It is important to note however that these models require multiple assessments waves (e.g., four or more to fully specify the LCM-SR), additional expertise to overcome issues with model convergence, and appreciation of modeling assumptions when attempting to adjudicate among potential models in each research context <span class="citation" data-cites="littlefield2021">(see <a href="#ref-littlefield2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2021?</strong></a>, for further discussion)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, many statistical models assume certain characteristics about the data to which they are being applied. Common assumptions of parametric statistical models (e.g., linear mixed-effects models) include normality and equality of variances. These assumptions must be carefully considered before finalizing analytical approaches, so that valid inferences can be made from the data, as violation of a model’s assumptions can substantively invalidate the interpretation of results. For example, longitudinal data can exhibit heterogeneous variability (i.e., the variance of the response changes over the duration of the study) that may need to be accounted for within a model. Another pertinent modeling assumption is whether trajectories are linear or non-linear. With 2-3 assessments per individual, only a linear model of within-person change is usually feasible; with more time points, higher level polynomials or models with more flexible trajectory shapes (e.g., curve smoothing via cubic splines) becomes possible [REFs]. Note, however, baseline age in the ABCD Study ranges over two full years; for some outcomes it may be desirable to include a (possibly nonlinear) effect of baseline age along with a linear effect of within-person change in age with only 2-3 assessment times <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson2013">(<a href="#ref-thompson2013" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>thompson2013?</strong></a>)</span>. As the study progresses and more times points are assessed, nonparametric curve estimation at the mean [GAMMs] and at the individual level may also become useful <span class="citation" data-cites="ramsay2002">(<a href="#ref-ramsay2002" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ramsay2002?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Implementing valid and efficient statistical models requires an understanding of the type of data being analyzed. For example, repeated assessments within the ABCD Study can be based on continuous or discrete measures. Examples of discrete measures include repeated assessments of binary variables (e.g., past 12-month alcohol use disorder status measured across ten years), ordinal variables (e.g., caregiver-reported items measuring emotional and behavioral concerns via the Child Behavior Checklist including the categories of “Not True”, “Somewhat True”, and “Very True”), and count variables (e.g., number of cigarettes smoked per day). In many ways, the distributional assumptions of indicators used in longitudinal designs mirror the decision points and considerations when delineating across different types of discrete outcome variables, a topic that spans entire textbooks <span class="citation" data-cites="lenz2016">(e.g., see <a href="#ref-lenz2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>lenz2016?</strong></a>)</span>. For example, the Mplus manual <span class="citation" data-cites="muthen2017">(<a href="#ref-muthen2017" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>muthen2017?</strong></a>)</span> includes examples of a) censored and censored-inflated models, b) linear growth models for binary or ordinal variables, c) linear growth models for a count outcome assuming a Poisson model, and d) linear growth models for a count outcome assuming a zero-inflated Poisson model. Beyond these highlighted examples, other distributions (e.g., negative binomial) can be assumed for the indicators when modeling longitudinal data <span class="citation" data-cites="ren2022">(<a href="#ref-ren2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ren2022?</strong></a>)</span>. These models can account for issues that can occur when working with discrete outcomes, including overdispersion [when the variance is higher than would be expected based on a given distribution; see <span class="citation" data-cites="lenz2016">(<a href="#ref-lenz2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>lenz2016?</strong></a>)</span>]. Given the sheer breadth of issues relevant to determining better models for discrete outcomes, it is not uncommon for texts on longitudinal data analysis to only cover models and approaches that assume continuous variables <span class="citation" data-cites="little2013">(e.g., <a href="#ref-little2013" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>little2013?</strong></a>)</span>. However, some textbooks on categorical data analysis provide more detailed coverage of the myriad issues and modeling choices to consider when working with discrete outcomes [e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="lenz2016">(<a href="#ref-lenz2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>lenz2016?</strong></a>)</span>, Chapter 11 for matched pair/two-assessment designs; Chapter 12 for marginal and transitional models for repeated designs, such as generalized estimating equations, and Chapter 13 for random effects models for discrete outcomes].</p>

<p>One can observe systematic changes over time in a variable of interest and assume this change is attributable to development. However, various pitfalls with longitudinal data can complicate or even invalidate this conclusion. For example, if data missingness or participant dropout are related to the values of the outcome, changing sample composition as the study progresses can bias mean trajectory estimates (we describe this in more detail in Section 3.1.7 below). Another prerequisite for valid developmental interpretations of longitudinal data is to establish whether a construct is measured consistently over time, i.e., longitudinal measurement invariance <span class="citation" data-cites="liu2017 van2015 willoughby2012">(<a href="#ref-liu2017" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>liu2017?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-van2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>van2015?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-willoughby2012" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>willoughby2012?</strong></a>)</span>. Establishing longitudinal measurement invariance provides researchers with greater confidence that any change over time identified for a construct is attributable to individual change rather than a measurement artifact. For example, one study using data from the ABCD Study [<span class="citation" data-cites="brislin2023">(<a href="#ref-brislin2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brislin2023?</strong></a>)</span>) found differential item functioning in two items from a brief delinquency measure, revealing significant bias in an arrest item across Black and White youth. More specifically, Black youth were more likely to report being arrested compared to White youth with similar levels of delinquency. Prevalence rates of delinquent behavior would have been severely biased if measurement invariance had not been tested.</p>
<p>Observed patterns of growth and decline often differ between cross-sectional vs.&nbsp;longitudinal effects <span class="citation" data-cites="salthouse2014">(<a href="#ref-salthouse2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>salthouse2014?</strong></a>)</span> where subjects gain increasing experience with the assessment with each successive measurement occasion. Such experience effects on cognitive functioning have been demonstrated in adolescent longitudinal samples similar to ABCD <span class="citation" data-cites="sullivan2017">(<a href="#ref-sullivan2017" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sullivan2017?</strong></a>)</span> and highlight the need to consider these effects and address them analytically. In the case of performance-based measures [e.g., matrix reasoning related to neurocognitive functioning; see <span class="citation" data-cites="salthouse2014">(<a href="#ref-salthouse2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>salthouse2014?</strong></a>)</span>], this can be due to “learning” the task from previous test administrations (e.g., someone taking the test a second time performs better than they did the first time simply as a function of having taken it before). Even in the case of non-performance-based measures (e.g., levels of depression), where one cannot easily make the argument that one has acquired some task-specific skill through learning, it has been observed that respondents tend to endorse lower levels on subsequent assessments <span class="citation" data-cites="beck1961 french2010">(e.g., <a href="#ref-beck1961" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>beck1961?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-french2010" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>french2010?</strong></a>)</span> and this phenomenon has been well documented in research using structured diagnostic interviews <span class="citation" data-cites="robins1985">(<a href="#ref-robins1985" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>robins1985?</strong></a>)</span>. While it is typically assumed that individuals are rescinding or telling us less information on follow-up interviews, there is reason to suspect that in some cases the initial assessment may be artefactually elevated <span class="citation" data-cites="shrout2018">(see <a href="#ref-shrout2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>shrout2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Some longitudinal studies, e.g., accelerated longitudinal designs [ALDs; <span class="citation" data-cites="thompson2011">(<a href="#ref-thompson2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>thompson2011?</strong></a>)</span>] are especially well suited for discovering these effects and modeling them. While ABCD is not an ALD, the variability in age (and grade in school) at the time of baseline recruitment (9 years, 0 months to 10 years, 11 months) allows some measures, collected every year, to be conceptualized as an ALD (e.g., substance use; prosocial behavior; family conflict; screen time). It is possible that in later waves, analyses will allow for disaggregating the confounded effects of age and the number of prior assessments. However, ABCD is fundamentally a single-cohort, longitudinal design, wherein number of prior assessments and age are mostly confounded, and for, perhaps, most analyses, the possible influence of experience effects needs to be kept in mind.</p>

<h3 data-number="3.1.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="covariance-structures"><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> Covariance Structures</h3>
<p>A central issue for repeated measurements on an individual is how to account for the correlated nature of the data. Traditional techniques, such as a standard regression or ANOVA model, assume residuals are independent and thus are inappropriate for designs that assess the same individuals across time. That is, given that residuals are no longer independent, the standard errors from the models are biased and can produce misleading inferential results. Although there are formal tests of independence for time series data (e.g., the Durbin-Watson statistic <span class="citation" data-cites="durbin1950">(<a href="#ref-durbin1950" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>durbin1950?</strong></a>)</span>, more commonly, independence is assumed to be violated in study designs with repeated assessments. Therefore, an initial question to be addressed by a researcher analyzing prospective data is how to best model the covariance structure of said data.</p>
<p>Statistical models for longitudinal data include two main components to account for assumptions that are commonly violated when working with repeated measures data: a model for the covariance among repeated measures (involving the covariance among pairs of repeated outcomes on an individual), coupled with a model for the mean response and its dependence on covariates (e.g., sex at birth). There exists a range of methods to model covariance structures, each with its own set of tradeoffs between model fit and parsimony and which may be more or less appropriate for each specific application <span class="citation" data-cites="kincaid2005">(e.g., see <a href="#ref-kincaid2005" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>kincaid2005?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are various approaches to adjust models for the lack of independence of residuals across time, be it for data with repeated assessments or other situations with so-called nested data (e.g., children nested within schools; siblings nested within families). The most common approach is to use random effects. Essentially, random effects allow for variance estimates around fixed effects. A classic example (from <span class="citation" data-cites="bryk1992">(<a href="#ref-bryk1992" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bryk1992?</strong></a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="singer1998">(<a href="#ref-singer1998" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>singer1998?</strong></a>)</span>) involves math achievement measured among students nested within schools. In a basic, intercept-only model with no covariates, there would be one fixed effect (the grand mean, or intercept, of math achievement) and two random effects (one representing variation in the intercept, or the variation between schools, and another for the within-school residual, or how much variance in math achievement is left over after taking into account nesting in school). From this framework, each student’s score would be a function of the fixed effect (the overall mean), the variation in scores that exists between schools, and the variation that exists among students within the same school. Assumptions about the variance and covariance components of this model dictate the form of the variance/covariance structure. For example, if we assume the random effects are independent (i.e., uncorrelated), the implied structure would be compound symmetry, where it is assumed the covariance of any two students in a single class is represented by a random effect (the variance between school means) and the covariance of any two students in different classes is zero. The assumptions of this relatively simple covariance structure can be relaxed, resulting in different covariance structures with additional parameters (see <span class="citation" data-cites="singer1998">(<a href="#ref-singer1998" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>singer1998?</strong></a>)</span>).</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, individual growth models could be fit to a series of repeated assessments, where assessments are nested within individuals. For example, an unconditional linear growth model would involve two fixed effects – one for the intercept (an estimate of the average score when time is coded zero) and one for the linear slope (an estimate of the change in scores for each unit increase in time). Random effects could include a random effect for intercept (or an estimate of the variation in scores when time is coded as zero), a random effect for the linear slope (or an estimate of the variation in linear change across time), and a random effect for the within-person residual (or an estimate of the left over variance, or residual, of a given assessment when accounting for the intercept and linear slope). Assumptions regarding the covariation among the random effects also indicate different covariance structures. For example, it is typical to assume the random intercept and random slope components covary (e.g., if time is coded such that the first time point = zero, the covariance estimate suggests that an individual’s score at baseline relates to the amount of change exhibited across time). Further, particularly in structural equation model forms of this model, it is typically assumed the random effect for the within-person residual varies across assessments (<span class="citation" data-cites="curran2003">(<a href="#ref-curran2003" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2003?</strong></a>)</span>).</p>
<p>One alternative structure that attempts to handle the reality that correlations between repeated assessments tend to diminish across time is the autoregressive design. As the name implies, the structure assumes a subsequent measurement occasion (e.g., assessment at Wave 2) is regressed onto (that is, is predicted by) a prior measurement occasion (e.g., assessment at Wave 1). The most common type of autoregressive design is the AR(1), where assessments at time T + 1 are regressed on assessments at Time T. Identical to compound symmetry, this model assumes the variances are homogenous across time. Diverting from compound symmetry, this model assumes the correlations between repeated assessments decline exponentially across measurement occasions rather than remaining constant. That is, we can think of the underlying process as a stochastic one that wears itself out over time. For example, per the AR(1) structure, if the correlation between Time 1 and Time 2 data is thought to be .5, then the correlation between Time 1 and Time 3 data would be assumed to be .5 × .5 = .25, and the correlation between Time 1 and Time 4 data would be assumed to be .5 × .5 × .5 = .125. As with compound symmetry, the basic AR(1) model is parsimonious in that it only requires two parameters (the variance of the assessments and the autoregressive coefficient). Notably, the assumption of constant autoregressive relations between assessments is often relaxed in commonly employed designs that use autoregressive modeling (e.g., cross-lagged panel models [CLPM]). These designs still typically assume an AR(1) process (e.g., it is sufficient to regress the Time 3 assessment onto the Time 2 assessment and is not necessary to also regress the Time 3 assessment onto the Time 1 assessment, which would result in an AR(2) process). However, the magnitude of these relations is often allowed to differ across different AR(1) pairs of assessment (e.g., the relation between Time 1 and Time 2 can be different from the relation between Time 2 and Time 3). These more commonly employed models also often relax the assumption of equal variances of the repeated assessments. Although the AR(1) structure may involve a more realistic set of assumptions compared to compound symmetry, in that the AR(1) model allows for diminishing correlations across time, the basic AR(1) model, as well as autoregressive models more generally, can also suffer from several limitations in contexts that are common in prospective designs. In particular, recent work demonstrates that if a construct being assessed prospectively across time is trait-like in nature, then a simple AR(1) process fail to adequately account for this trait-like structure, with the downstream consequence that estimates derived from models based on AR structures (such as the CLPM) can be misleading and fail to adequately demarcate between- vs.&nbsp;within-person sources of variance <span class="citation" data-cites="hamaker2015">(<a href="#ref-hamaker2015" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hamaker2015?</strong></a>)</span>. Finally, it is also worth noting that in many longitudinal contexts, the time intervals between assessments are not equidistant and researchers need to consider carefully how to appropriately model time in their model and what this model implies.</p>

<p>Attrition from a longitudinal panel study such as ABCD is inevitable and represents a potential threat to the validity of longitudinal analyses and cross-sectional analyses conducted at later time points, especially since attrition can only be expected to grow over time<span class="citation" data-cites="littlefield2022">(<a href="#ref-littlefield2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2022?</strong></a>)</span>. The ABCD Retention Workgroup (RW) employs a data-driven approach to examine, track, and intervene in these issues and while preliminary findings show participant race and parent education level to be associated with late and missing visits, although to date, attrition in ABCD has been minimal <span class="citation" data-cites="ewing2022">(<a href="#ref-ewing2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>ewing2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Ideally, one tries to minimize attrition through good retention practices from the outset via strategies designed to maintain engagement in the project <span class="citation" data-cites="cotter2005 hill2016 watson2018">(<a href="#ref-cotter2005" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>cotter2005?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-hill2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hill2016?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-watson2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>watson2018?</strong></a>)</span>. However, even the best-executed studies need to anticipate growing attrition over the length of the study and implement analytic strategies designed to provide the most valid inferences. Perhaps the most key concern when dealing with data that is missing due to attrition is determining the degree of bias in retained variables that is a consequence of attrition. Such bias can attenuate generalizability, particularly if the pattern of missingness is not random (e.g., certain subsets of the population are more likely to drop out/not attend a visit). Assuming that the data are not missing completely at random, attention to the nature of the missingness and employing techniques designed to mitigate attrition-related biases need to be considered in all longitudinal analyses.</p>
<p>Three types of missingness are considered in the literature <span class="citation" data-cites="little1989">(see <a href="#ref-little1989" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>little1989?</strong></a>)</span>, namely: a) missing completely at random (MCAR), b) missing at random (MAR), and c) missing not at random (MNAR). Data that are MCAR are a simple random sample of all data in a given dataset. MAR implies missing data are a random sample (i.e., does not hinge on some unmeasured variables) within strata of the measured covariates in a dataset (e.g., biological sex). Data that are MNAR are missing as a function of unobserved variables and may bias assocations even after conditioning on the observed covariates. <span class="citation" data-cites="graham2009">(<a href="#ref-graham2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>graham2009?</strong></a>)</span> provides an excellent and easy-to-digest overview of further details involving missing data considerations.</p>
<p>Modern approaches for handling missing data, such as full information maximum likelihood, propensity weighting, auxiliary variables and multiple imputation avoid the biases of older approaches <span class="citation" data-cites="enders2010 graham2009">(see <a href="#ref-enders2010" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>enders2010?</strong></a>; <a href="#ref-graham2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>graham2009?</strong></a>)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="graham2009">(<a href="#ref-graham2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>graham2009?</strong></a>)</span> noted several “myths” regarding missing data. For example, Graham notes many assume the data must be minimally MAR to permit estimating procedures (such as maximum likelihood or multiple imputation) compared to other, more traditional approaches (e.g., using only complete case data). Violations of MAR impact both traditional and more modern data estimation procedures, though as noted by Graham, violations of MAR tend to have a greater effect on older methods. Graham thus suggests that imputing missing data is a better approach compared to listwise deletion in most circumstances, regardless of the model of missingness [i.e., MCAR, MAR, MNAR; see <span class="citation" data-cites="graham2009">(<a href="#ref-graham2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>graham2009?</strong></a>)</span>].</p>

<p>Given that longitudinal data involve multiple sources of variance, quantifying effect sizes longitudinally is a more difficult task compared to deriving such estimates from cross-sectional data. An effect size can be defined as, “a population parameter (estimated in a sample) encapsulating the practical or clinical importance of a phenomenon under study.” <span class="citation" data-cites="kraemer2014">(<a href="#ref-kraemer2014" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>kraemer2014?</strong></a>)</span>. Common effect size metrics include the correlation r between two variables and the standardized difference between two means, Cohen’s <em>d</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="cohen1988">(<a href="#ref-cohen1988" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>cohen1988?</strong></a>)</span>. An extensive discussion of effect sizes and their relevance for ABCD is given in <span class="citation" data-cites="dick2021">(<a href="#ref-dick2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>dick2021?</strong></a>)</span>. Adjustments to common effect size calculations, such as Cohen’s d, are required even when only two time points are considered (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="morris2002">(<a href="#ref-morris2002" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>morris2002?</strong></a>)</span>]. <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2019">(<a href="#ref-wang2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wang2019?</strong></a>)</span> note there are multiple approaches to obtaining standardized within-person effects, and that commonly suggested approaches (e.g., global standardization) can be problematic <span class="citation" data-cites="wang2019">(see <a href="#ref-wang2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>wang2019?</strong></a>, for more details)</span>. Thus, obtaining effect size metrics based on standardized estimates that are relatively simple in cross-sectional data (such as r) becomes more complex in the context of prospective longitudinal data. <span class="citation" data-cites="feingold2009">(<a href="#ref-feingold2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>feingold2009?</strong></a>)</span> noted that equations for effects sizes used in studies involving growth modeling analysis (e.g., latent growth curve modeling) were not mathematically equivalent, and the effect sizes were not in the same metric as effect sizes from traditional analysis <span class="citation" data-cites="feingold2009">(see <a href="#ref-feingold2009" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>feingold2009?</strong></a>, for more details)</span>. Given this issue, there have been various proposals for adjusting effect size measures in repeated assessments. <span class="citation" data-cites="feingold2019">(<a href="#ref-feingold2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>feingold2019?</strong></a>)</span> reviews the approach for effect size metrics for analyses based on growth modeling, including when considering linear and non-linear (i.e., quadratic) growth factors. <span class="citation" data-cites="morris2002">(<a href="#ref-morris2002" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>morris2002?</strong></a>)</span> review various equations for effect size calculations relevant to combining estimates in meta-analysis with repeated measures and independent-groups designs. Other approaches to quantifying effect sizes longitudinally may be based on standardized estimates from models that more optimally disentangle between- and within-person sources of variance. As an example, within a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) framework, standardized estimates between random intercepts (i.e., the correlation between two random intercepts for two different constructs assessed repeatedly) could be used to index the between-person relation, whereas standardized estimates among the structured residuals could be used as informing the effect sizes of within-person relations.</p>

<p>An ideal longitudinal study integrates (a) a well-articulated theoretical model, (b) an appropriate longitudinal data structure, and (c) a statistical model that is an operationalization of the theoretical model <span class="citation" data-cites="collins2006">(<a href="#ref-collins2006" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>collins2006?</strong></a>)</span>. To accommodate various research questions and contexts, different types of longitudinal data and data structures have emerged (see Figure <strong>X</strong>). An understanding of these data structures is helpful, as they can warrant different types of longitudinal data analysis (LDA). Given that identifying a starting point for making comparisons is somewhat arbitrary, Curran and Bauer [2019; <span class="citation" data-cites="bauer2019">(<a href="#ref-bauer2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bauer2019?</strong></a>)</span>] provide a nice on-ramp in first distinguishing between the use of “time-to-event” and “repeated measures” data. Although both model time, the former is concerned with whether and when an event occurs, whereas the later is focused on growth and change <span class="citation" data-cites="bauer2019">(<a href="#ref-bauer2019" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>bauer2019?</strong></a>)</span>. Time-to-event structures measure time from a well-defined origin point up to the occurrence of an event of interest. This data structure is most often analyzed using survival analysis methods (e.g., hazard rate models, event history analysis, failure-time models) and the time-to-event data can be based on a single assessment or include multiple recurrent or competing events. While much has been written about “time-to-event” data (<strong>see xxx; xxx; xxxx</strong>), including a recent analysis examining exclusionary discipline in schools using data from the ABCD Study (<span class="citation" data-cites="brislin2023">(<a href="#ref-brislin2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brislin2023?</strong></a>)</span>), our emphasis will be given to the modeling of “repeated measures” data. manuscript/ <!-- [![Longitudinal Data Analysis Structural Diagram](../img/LDAStructure2.png)](https://centerstat.org/resources/) --></p>
<p>When discussing longitudinal analysis, we are most often talking about data collected on the same unit (e.g., individuals) across multiple measurement occasions. However, repeated-measures analysis is not a monolith, and it will serve us well to distinguish between a few of the most common types. One such approach to repeated measures analysis is the use of time-series models. These models generally consist of a long sequence of repeated measurements (≧ 50-100 measurements) on a single (or small number of) variable of interest. Time-series analysis is often used to predict/forecast temporal trends and cyclic patterns and is geared toward making inferences about prospective outcomes within a population (with relatively with less focus on inferring individual-level mechanisms and risk factors). A related type of repeated measures analysis is Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD). Similar to time-series analysis, ILD models involve frequent measurements (~ 30-40 measurements) of the same individuals in a relatively circumspect period of time (e.g., experience sampling to obtain time series on many individuals). Although ILD models may include slightly fewer measurement occasions than time-series data, ILD models tend to have more subjects than time series models (~ 50-100 subjects). This allows ILD models to examine short-term patterns by incorporating a time series model that can sometimes fit parameter estimates to each individual’s data in order to model individual difference outcomes. The final type of repeated measures analysis that we will primarily focus on is the longitudinal panel model. These models follow a group of individuals— a panel (also referred to as a cohort) — across relatively fewer measurement occassions (~ 5-15), and are often interested in examining change across both, within-individuals and between-individuals.</p>
<p>While other longitudinal designs have their own unique strengths and applications, the longitudinal panel design is particularly well-suited for investigating developmental processes in the context of the ABCD Study. In the following sections, we will discuss various analytic methods commonly used to analyze longitudinal panel data, including growth models, mixed models, and a number of additional trajectory models. These methods provide valuable insights into within- and between-individual differences and are highly relevant for researchers working with the ABCD Study dataset. By focusing on these methods, we aim to equip readers with the knowledge necessary to conduct longitudinal research and perform analyses using the rich, longitudinal, and publicly available data from the ABCD Study.</p>

<p>With the large and continually expanding body of research on statistical methods for longitudinal analyses, determining which longitudinal model to implement can be challenging. The aim of this section is to help researchers navigate these many options to identify the statistical approach most appropriate to their unique research question when deciding on how to measure change over time. Notably, there are a myriad of viable ways one can go about grouping various types of longitudinal models for presentation.</p>
<p>Common examples include grouping by linear vs nonlinear models <span class="citation" data-cites="collins2006">(<a href="#ref-collins2006" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>collins2006?</strong></a>)</span>, the number of measurement occasions <span class="citation" data-cites="king2018">(<a href="#ref-king2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>king2018?</strong></a>)</span>, and statistical equivalency [e.g., change scores vs.&nbsp;residualized change; see <span class="citation" data-cites="castro-schilo2018">(<a href="#ref-castro-schilo2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>castro-schilo2018?</strong></a>)</span>].

In the following sections, we briefly summarize the advantages/disadvantages of a series of longitudinal models organized into the following groupings: Traditional Models, Modern GLM Extensions, SEM, and Advanced SEM. We note that this is not an exhaustive review of each of these methods, and for more in-depth detail we do provide the reader with relevant resources.

<section id="traditional-models" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="traditional-models">Traditional Models</h4>
<p>Traditional methods for longitudinal analysis primarily focus on modeling mean-level change, and how these changes may differ across groups or levels of some other variable. For example, is there a difference in average internalizing symptoms obtained across multiple assessments between boys and girls? Longitudinal models that focus on mean-level change are also referred to as marginal models and examples of specific methods include repeated measures ANOVA (and MANOVA), ANCOVA, and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs). Mean-level change models are commonly used when data is only available from 2 measurement occasions. For example, computing a difference score (e.g., mean internalizing scores at time 2 - mean internalizing scores at time 1) that can be used as an outcome in a subsequent GLM analysis (e.g., paired-samples t-test, repeated measures ANOVA) to test for differences in patterns of change over time and between groups. Additionally, the longitudinal signed-rank test, a nonparametric alternative to the paired t-test, can be a useful tool for analyzing non-normal paired data. Another common approach, often used in pre-/post-design studies but can be used with ABCD Study data, is to use residualized change score analysis to assess the degree of change in a variable, while controlling for its initial level <span class="citation" data-cites="castro-schilo2018">(<a href="#ref-castro-schilo2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>castro-schilo2018?</strong></a>)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, to examine change in cortico-limbic connectivity among ABCD participants, <span class="citation" data-cites="brieant2021">(<a href="#ref-brieant2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>brieant2021?</strong></a>)</span> regressed cortico-limbic connectivity at the year 2 follow-up on baseline cortico-limbic connectivity, which allowed the authors to examine the associations between negative life events and the variance of cortico-limbic connectivity unexplained by baseline connectivity. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="romer2021">(<a href="#ref-romer2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>romer2021?</strong></a>)</span> used a residualized-change model to examine the bidirectional influences of executive functioning and a general psychopathology factor ‘p’ across the first two years of the ABCD Study. Both studies were able to conclude associations between their constructs of interest that could not be accounted for by prior frequencies at baseline.</p>
<p>Traditional longitudinal, such as residualized chance score models, can be useful in some contexts (e.g., two measurement occasions), but overall, their practical utility for answering questions about developmental processes is limited. Perhaps most notably, these models do not allow for characterizing patterns of within-person change. This is a particularly important limitation since most psychological theories posit within-person processes (i.e., what will happen within a given individual). As such, traditional approaches often correspond poorly with most theoretical models of change and a failure to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects can result in consequential errors of inference <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2011">(e.g., ecological fallacy, <a href="#ref-curran2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2011?</strong></a>)</span>. Moreover, even determining which of these procedures to use for comparing change over two time points across groups can be surprisingly complicated. A particularly vexing example is that of imbalanced baseline scores (i.e., when baseline scores are correlated with a covariate of interest), which can produce different conclusions across methods [e.g., <strong>X versus X</strong>; see <span class="citation" data-cites="littlefield2023">(<a href="#ref-littlefield2023" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2023?</strong></a>)</span>, for a review]. Given these shortcomings, and the complexity of the issues surrounding some of these methods, it is typically recommended that researchers make use of more modern approaches for analyzing longitudinal data (and preferably make use of data collected across three or more time points, as is currently true for many ABCD assessments).</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modern-glm-extensions">Modern GLM Extensions</h4>
<p>Modern approaches to longitudinal data analysis have advanced beyond traditional methods by offering greater flexibility and a more in-depth understanding of within-person and between-person variability. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), Linear Mixed Models (LMM), Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), and Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Panel Models (ARCL) are examples of such contemporary techniques. GEE, an extension of Generalized Linear Models, combines the generalized linear model for non-normal outcomes with repeated measures (marginal) model and is suitable for analyzing correlated longitudinal data and modeling population-averaged effects. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="vandijk2021">(<a href="#ref-vandijk2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>vandijk2021?</strong></a>)</span> used GEE to obtain relative risks for psychiatric diagnoses among children in the ABCD Study with a family history of depression and used the ABCD Study sampling weights to generalize prevalence rates among 9 and 10 year-olds across the US. LMMs, also known as multilevel or hierarchical linear models, facilitate the simultaneous analysis of within-person and between-person variability, making them ideal for nested data structures or repeated measures. Within the ABCD Study, reseachers may want to consider nesting by individual, family (i.e., siblings or twins), school or district, and/or site. GLMMs further extend the LMM framework to accommodate non-normal response variables, such as binary, count, or ordinal data, such as the use of ABCD data on substance use <span class="citation" data-cites="martz2022">(e.g., <a href="#ref-martz2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>martz2022?</strong></a>)</span> screen media use <span class="citation" data-cites="lees2020">(<a href="#ref-lees2020" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>lees2020?</strong></a>)</span>, and microstructure of the brain <span class="citation" data-cites="palmer2022">(<a href="#ref-palmer2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>palmer2022?</strong></a>)</span>. Finally, ARCL models are used to investigate reciprocal relationships between variables over time, as they estimate both autoregressive and cross-lagged effects [although, ARCL models are relatively less useful for teasing apart between-person and within-person sources of variances; see <span class="citation" data-cites="curran2021">(<a href="#ref-curran2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>curran2021?</strong></a>)</span>].</p>
<p>The strengths of these modern methods lie in their ability to account for individual differences, within-person change, and time-varying predictors, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex relationships in longitudinal data. Despite these advantages, modern approaches may require more complex modeling assumptions and higher computational demands compared to traditional methods. Additionally, proper model specification and the interpretation of results can be more challenging, especially in cases of high multicollinearity or missing data. However, modern longitudinal analysis methods have generally surpassed traditional methods in addressing a wider range of research questions, accommodating diverse data structures, and elucidating the intricate dynamics of developmental processes.</p>

<section id="sem" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sem">SEM</h4>
<p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches have gained prominence in longitudinal data analysis due to their ability to estimate complex relationships among observed and latent variables while accounting for measurement error. SEM techniques can be categorized into variable-centered, person-centered, and hybrid approaches, each with unique strengths and limitations. The choice of method depends on the research question, data structure, and underlying assumptions.</p>
<p>Variable-centered approaches, such as latent change scores, latent growth curve models, multivariate (parallel process) latent growth curve models, and latent state-trait models, focus on examining relationships among variables and population-level patterns. These models offer a powerful means to estimate individual change trajectories and the relationships between growth parameters of different variables, while also decomposing observed measurements into latent state and trait components. However, these approaches may not adequately capture distinct subgroups of individuals who share similar patterns of change over time, which can be crucial for understanding heterogeneous developmental processes.</p>
<p>Person-centered approaches, including latent transition analysis and latent class growth analysis, address this limitation by identifying subgroups of individuals who share similar patterns of change. These models can reveal meaningful subpopulations and help researchers understand the factors that contribute to differences in developmental trajectories. For example, taking advantage of the large sample size of the ABCD Study, <span class="citation" data-cites="xiang2022">(<a href="#ref-xiang2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>xiang2022?</strong></a>)</span> found evidence of four subgroups of youth with unique longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms over time and identified risk factors that were differentially associated with the various trajectories. The use of such models allows for a more nuanced understanding of the associations between risk factors and change in symptomatology, as opposed to a snapshot of symptomatology at a single time point. Despite a range of potential model specifications for longitudinal mixture modeling, person-centered approaches tend to use parameterizations that default to settings found in popular software packages (e.g., Mplus). It has recently been demonstrated (see <span class="citation" data-cites="mcneish2021">(<a href="#ref-mcneish2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>mcneish2021?</strong></a>)</span>) that the use of such specifications tends to identify the so-called “cat’s cradle” solution (see <span class="citation" data-cites="sher2011">(<a href="#ref-sher2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sher2011?</strong></a>)</span>) that consists of “…(a) a consistently ‘low’ group, (b) an ‘increase’ group, (c) a ‘decrease’ group, and (d) a consistently ‘high’ group” (<span class="citation" data-cites="sher2011">(<a href="#ref-sher2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sher2011?</strong></a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;322). Indeed, <span class="citation" data-cites="xiang2022">(<a href="#ref-xiang2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>xiang2022?</strong></a>)</span> describe their four-group solution as follows: “Of all participants, 536 (10.80%) were classified as increasing, 269 (5.42%) as persistently high, 433 (8.73%) as decreasing, and 3724 (75.05%) as persistently low” (<span class="citation" data-cites="xiang2022">(<a href="#ref-xiang2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>xiang2022?</strong></a>)</span>, p.&nbsp;162). Although <span class="citation" data-cites="sher2011">(<a href="#ref-sher2011" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>sher2011?</strong></a>)</span> cautioned that groups from these trajectory-based approaches should not be over-reified, this practice also remains common (e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="hawes2016">(<a href="#ref-hawes2016" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hawes2016?</strong></a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="hawes2018">(<a href="#ref-hawes2018" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>hawes2018?</strong></a>)</span>). Thus, though person-centered approaches can, in theory, help researchers understand the factors that contribute to differences in developmental trajectories, researchers should more thoughtfully consider alternative specifications (see <span class="citation" data-cites="littlefield2010">(<a href="#ref-littlefield2010" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>littlefield2010?</strong></a>)</span>, as an example) and be especially skeptical when default specifications identify these four prototypic groups.</p>
<p>Hybrid approaches, such as growth mixture modeling, combine aspects of both variable-centered and person-centered models, allowing for the identification of latent subgroups while also modeling relationships among growth parameters. This combination provides a more comprehensive understanding of longitudinal data by capturing both within- and between-person variability. However, hybrid models can be more complex, necessitating careful model specification, selection, and interpretation. Additionally, these methods may require larger sample sizes to ensure the stability and accuracy of results.</p>
<p>In summary, SEM approaches offer powerful tools for longitudinal data analysis, enabling researchers to investigate complex relationships, individual differences, and change dynamics over time. The choice between variable-centered, person-centered, and hybrid approaches depends on the research objectives and the nature of the data. Despite their limitations, these models have greatly advanced our understanding of developmental processes and the factors that contribute to individual differences in change trajectories.</p>

<section id="advanced-sem" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="advanced-sem">Advanced SEM</h4>
<p>Advanced structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches, such as the RI-CLPM and LCM-SR models, have emerged to address more complex research questions and data structures in longitudinal analysis. These advanced models extend traditional SEM techniques, enabling researchers to disentangle within-person and between-person effects, as well as capture additional time-specific dependencies and associations that may not be accounted for by the latent growth factors.</p>
<p>The RI-CLPM enhances the traditional cross-lagged panel model by incorporating random intercepts, which allow for the separation of stable individual differences from the dynamic within-person associations between variables over time. Within-person variance in these models are captured by a series of latent variables that reflect time specific variance (i.e., the residual variance from the random intercept). These time-specific variables are referred to as structured residuals. Distinguishing between-person variance subsumed by the random intercept from the structured residuals is particularly valuable for understanding the time-specific effects of one variable on another, while accounting for the influence of individual differences. However, RI-CLPM may require larger sample sizes to ensure stability and accuracy of the estimates and can be computationally demanding. Using three waves of ABCD Study data, <span class="citation" data-cites="kulisch2022">(<a href="#ref-kulisch2022" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>kulisch2022?</strong></a>)</span> found a prospective association between psychopathology and childhood obesity as well as between childhood obesity and later eating behavior. The authors also showed that reciprocal associations were overestimated when stable, interindividual trait differences was not included in the model (i.e., via the random intercept).</p>
<p>LCM-SR, on the other hand, extends the RI-CLPM by including additional growth factors, such as a random linear slope. That is, the LCM-SR is a hybrid between a latent growth model and CLPM. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of within-person change dynamics and factors influencing change over time. By including structured residuals, LCM-SR can capture additional time-specific relationships that are not explained by the latent growth factors. However, even more so than the RI-CLPM, LCM-SR comes with increased model complexity and requires careful specification and interpretation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, advanced SEM approaches for longitudinal data analysis provide valuable tools for addressing complex research questions and data structures. While they offer more nuanced insights into within-person change dynamics and the influence of individual differences, these models also come with certain limitations, such as the necessity of multiple assessments (e.g., four or more for LCM-SR), increased complexity, computational demands, and the need for careful model specification and interpretation. As with any statistical method, researchers should carefully consider their research objectives, data characteristics, and the assumptions of each model when selecting the most appropriate advanced SEM approach for longitudinal analysis. Given that these modeling approaches necessitate more waves of data, they are not yet commonly used with ABCD Study data. We anticipate that as more waves of ABCD data are publically released, these models can be used to address some of the pitfalls of the more traditional methods.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As we enter the era of large-scale longitudinal investigations, it is essential to critically examine the various analytical methods that can be employed to glean insights from these rich datasets. The complex nature of longitudinal data demands sophisticated and well-suited methodologies to accurately address research questions and minimize biases. This paper aimed to provide an overview of diverse longitudinal analysis techniques, with a particular emphasis on their application to extensive longitudinal studies such as the ABCD Study. Beyond contributing to the ever-growing body of knowledge on longitudinal data analysis, we hope this manuscript also serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to optimize the use of large-scale longitudinal investigations in advancing our understanding of human development and behavior. In this discussion, we will focus on the key findings and recommendations of our review and discuss potential innovations that can further enhance the utility of these methods.</p>
<p>We began by addressing fundamental concepts and considerations in longitudinal research that are essential for generating accurate and meaningful insights into developmental processes. Concepts such as vulnerable periods, developmental disturbances and snares, or cascade and experience effects (among many others), are instrumental in shaping the design, analysis, and interpretation of longitudinal studies. Together, these concepts provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the course of development, while also accounting for the complex interplay between individual development and the influence of environmental factors. By considering the intricate relationships among these factors, researchers can better identify the critical time periods, situations, and contexts that contribute to individual differences in developmental outcomes. This awareness enables more precise inferences regarding the causal relationships between exposures and outcomes, ultimately leading to more robust and meaningful findings that can help facilitate the translation of research findings into practical applications in clinical and public health settings.</p>
<p>We also discussed some of the opportunities, challenges, and pitfalls that arise when working with longitudinal data. Key issues include selecting appropriate methods to account for the intricacies of longitudinal data, addressing missing data in a way that minimizes biases, and determining suitable longitudinal data structures that align with research questions and context. To address these challenges, researchers should carefully consider issues such as study design, selection of methods that account for both within- and between-person sources of variance, and employing modern techniques, (e.g., FIML, multiple imputation) for handling missing data. By adhering to best practices in longitudinal research and remaining vigilant of potential pitfalls, researchers can effectively harness the power of longitudinal data to maximize the potential of their investigations and gain valuable insights into complex developmental processes, individual differences, and the underlying mechanisms that drive change over time.</p>
<p>The final section, along with associated code and additional resources made available as online supplements (), aims to serve as a resource for researchers seeking to understand and implement various longitudinal panel models. By providing an overview of different approaches, their strengths and limitations, and key considerations for their use, we hope to facilitate the selection of appropriate models tailored to specific research questions and data structures. It is essential for researchers to consider their research objectives, the characteristics of their data, and the assumptions underlying each model when choosing the most suitable approach for longitudinal analysis. We encourage researchers to consult the cited literature and online supplements for further guidance in selecting and implementing longitudinal models when using the ABCD Study dataset. As the field continues to advance, we anticipate the emergence of new methods and refinements to existing approaches, further expanding the toolkit available to researchers for the analysis of longitudinal data. By staying informed about developments in this area and critically evaluating the appropriateness of different models for their research questions, researchers can ensure that their longitudinal analyses are both rigorous and informative. Notably, in this vast and continually evolving field, with numerous models and approaches available to address a wide range of research questions, no single model is universally applicable or without limitations. The diversity of methods ensures that researchers can find an appropriate tool for their specific needs. By familiarizing themselves with the various types of longitudinal models, researchers can more effectively navigate the complexities of longitudinal data and contribute valuable insights into the developmental processes and individual differences that shape human experience.</p>

<span id="cb1-128"><a href="#cb1-128"></a><span class="co">  The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development^SM (ABCD) Study provides a unique opportunity for researchers to investigate developmental processes in a large, diverse cohort of youths, aged 9-10 at baseline and assessed annually for 10 years. Given the size and complexity of the ABCD Study©, researchers analyzing its data will encounter a myriad of methodological and analytical considerations. This review provides an examination of key concepts and techniques related to longitudinal analyses of the ABCD Study data.  We discuss the importance of longitudinal data, focusing on the types of inferences that are possible when one assesses individuals across multiple time points, including: 1) characterization of the factors associated with variation in developmental trajectories; 2) assessment of how level and timing of exposures may impact subsequent development; 3) quantification of how variation in developmental domains may be associated with outcomes, including mediation models and reciprocal relationships. We emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate statistical models to address these research questions, e.g., accounting for correlation in repeated measurements, employing linear or non-linear models as indicated by the data, and using link functions that adequately model outcome distributions. By presenting the advantages and potential challenges of longitudinal analyses in the ABCD Study, this review seeks to equip researchers with foundational knowledge and tools to make informed decisions as they navigate and effectively analyze and interpret the multi-dimensional longitudinal data currently available.</span></span>

<span id="cb1-141"><a href="#cb1-141"></a>\label{sec:headings} <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study®</span><span class="co">](https://abcdstudy.org/ "Visit the ABCD Study website")</span>{#abcdwebsite} is the largest long-term investigation of neurodevelopment and child health in the United States. Conceived and initiated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), this landmark prospective longitudinal study aims to transform our understanding of the genetic and environmental factors impacting neurodevelopment and their roles in behavioral and health outcomes across ten years of adolescence (Volkow et al. 2018). At its heart, the study is designed to chart the course of human development across multiple interacting domains from late childhood to early adulthood and to identify factors that lead to both positive and negative outcomes. Central to achieving these goals is the commitment of the ABCD Study® and its NIH funders to an open science framework, intended to facilitate sharing of data and analytical methods, by espousing practices that increase access, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research. In this sense, the ABCD Study is a collaboration with the larger research community. </span>
<span id="cb1-142"><a href="#cb1-142"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-143"><a href="#cb1-143"></a>The size and scope of the ABCD Study data allow the research community to perform a large variety of developmental analyses of both substantive and methodological interest,  presenting a unique opportunity to significantly advance our understanding of how a multitude of biopsychosocial processes unfold across critical periods of development. In this paper, we describe models and methods for longitudinal analysis of ABCD Study data that can address these fundamental scientific aims, including: 1) characterization of the genetic and environmental factors associated with variation in developmental trajectories; 2) assessment of how the level and timing of exposures may impact subsequent neurodevelopment; 3) quantification of how variation in developmental domains may be associated with outcomes, including mediation models and reciprocal relationships. We instantiate these longitudinal analyses in worked examples using the ABCD Release 5.0 data with accompanying R scripts. Worked examples are available in Quarto files, accessible at **XXXX**.</span>

<span id="cb1-146"><a href="#cb1-146"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-147"><a href="#cb1-147"></a>The ABCD Study enrolled a cohort of n=11,880 participants born between 2006-2008 and aged between 9-11 years at baseline, as well as their parents/guardians. The study sample was recruited from household populations in defined catchment areas for each of the 21 (originally 22) study sites across the United States. Information regarding funding agencies, recruitment sites, investigators, and project organization can be obtained at https://abcdstudy.org/. The ABCD Study design is described in more detail in @garavan2018 and @dick2021.</span>
<span id="cb1-148"><a href="#cb1-148"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-149"><a href="#cb1-149"></a>The ABCD Study is currently collecting longitudinal data on a rich variety of outcomes that will enable the construction of complex statistical models potentially incorporating factors from many domains. Each new wave of data collection provides another building block for characterizing developmental trajectories and implementing longitudinal analyses that allow researchers to characterize normative development, to identify variables that presage deviations from normative development, and to assess a range of variables associated with biopsychosocial outcomes of interest. These data include: 1) a neurocognitive battery <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@luciana2018a; @thompson2019</span><span class="co">]</span>; 2) mental and physical health assessments <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@barch2018</span><span class="co">]</span>; 3) measures of culture and environment <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@gonzalez2021; @zucker2018</span><span class="co">]</span>; 4) substance use <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lisdahl2021</span><span class="co">]</span>; 5) gender identity and sexual health <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@potter2022</span><span class="co">]</span>; 6) biospecimens <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@uban2018</span><span class="co">]</span>; 7) structural and functional brain imaging <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@casey2018; @hagler2019</span><span class="co">]</span>; 8) geolocation-based environmental exposure data <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@fan2021</span><span class="co">]</span>; 9) wearables, and mobile technology <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@bagot2018</span><span class="co">]</span>; and 10) whole genome genotyping <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@loughnan2020</span><span class="co">]</span>. Many of these measures are collected at in-person annual visits, with brain imaging collected at baseline and every other year going forward. A limited number of assessments are collected in semi-annual telephone interviews between in-person visits. </span>
<span id="cb1-150"><a href="#cb1-150"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-151"><a href="#cb1-151"></a>Data are publicly released roughly annually, currently through the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). By necessity, the study’s earliest data releases consisted primarily of one or two visits per participant. However, the most recent public release as of the writing of this paper (Release 5.0) contains data collected across five annual visits, including three brain imaging assessments (baseline, year 2 follow-up, and year 4 follow-up visits) for at least a subset of the cohort. Hence, starting with Release 5.0, it is feasible for researchers to begin focusing on the estimation of neurodevelopmental and other trajectories.</span>

<span id="cb1-179"><a href="#cb1-179"></a><span class="fu">## Basic Concepts and Considerations</span></span>
<span id="cb1-180"><a href="#cb1-180"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-181"><a href="#cb1-181"></a>There are several important concepts to consider when conducting longitudinal analyses in a developmental context. These include different ways of thinking about developmental course, whether certain periods of development are relatively sensitive or insensitive to various types of insults or stressors, whether some time periods or situations inhibit the expression of individual differences due to extreme environmental pressures, and whether the same behavior manifested at different times represents the same or different phenomena.</span>
<span id="cb1-182"><a href="#cb1-182"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-183"><a href="#cb1-183"></a>Moreover, in the case of developmentally-focused longitudinal research, each new measurement occasion not only provides a more extended portrait of the child’s life course but also brings with it greater methodological opportunities to make use of statistical models that distinguish within- from between-person effects and that loosen constraints that need to be imposed on the furtherance of critical scientific questions.</span>
<span id="cb1-184"><a href="#cb1-184"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-185"><a href="#cb1-185"></a>For example, collecting two or more within-person observations on the same construct at different times enables estimation of individual rates of change (slopes); more observations allow for more precise estimates of individual slopes, as well as characterization of non-linear development. Rate of change or other trajectory characteristics may be more informative about individuals than the simple snapshots of level differences that cross-sectional data are limited to informing. Cross-sectional age-related differences across individuals are poor substitutes for longitudinal trajectory estimates except under highly restrictive assumptions, e.g., parallel trajectories and lack of age cohort and experience effects <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@thompson2011</span><span class="co">]</span>. Appreciation of these and other issues can help to guide the analysis and interpretation of data and aid translation to clinical and public health applications.</span>
<span id="cb1-186"><a href="#cb1-186"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-187"><a href="#cb1-187"></a><span class="fu">### Vulnerable periods.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-188"><a href="#cb1-188"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-189"><a href="#cb1-189"></a>Adolescent development progresses normatively from less mature to more mature levels of functioning. However, unique epochs and experiences can alter the course of this idealized form of development. Consider research that shows cannabis use during adolescence is associated with later psychosis to a greater degree than cannabis use initiated later in development <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@arseneault2002; @bechtold2016; @hasan2020; @semple2005</span><span class="co">]</span>; or similarly, experimental research on rodents that shows rodent brains to be especially sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on brain structure and learning early in development, corresponding to early adolescence in humans <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@spear2016; @crews2000; @ji2018</span><span class="co">]</span>. In another example, longitudinal data from the National Consortium on Alcohol in Adolescence (NCANDA) show that binge drinking is associated more strongly with decrements in gray matter volume early in adolescence compared to later <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@infante2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. These examples highlight the importance of considering the role of vulnerable periods – e.g., temporal windows of rapid brain development or remodeling during which the effects of environmental stimuli on the developing brain may be particularly pronounced– when trying to establish an accurate understanding of the association between exposures and outcomes.</span>
<span id="cb1-190"><a href="#cb1-190"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-191"><a href="#cb1-191"></a><span class="fu">### Developmental disturbances.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-192"><a href="#cb1-192"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-193"><a href="#cb1-193"></a>Whereas vulnerable periods heighten neurobiological susceptibility to environmental influences, at other times, environmental exposures will tend to suppress stability and disrupt the orderly stochastic process of normative development <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @schulenberg2019</span><span class="co">]</span>. This situation reflects a developmental disturbance in that the normal course of development is “altered” for a time by some time-limited process. In such cases, we might find that prediction of behavior in the period of the disturbance is reduced and/or, similarly, the behavior exhibited during the disturbance might have less predictive power with respect to distal outcomes compared to the behavior exhibited before and following the disrupted period. That is, once the environmental presses are removed (or the individual is removed from the environment), patterns of individual differences (and autoregressive effects) recover to levels similar to those prior to entering the environment. For example, in @infante2022, recent binge drinking appears to be most predictive of gray matter volume trajectories, as opposed to more distal prior binge drinking or cumulative number of binge drinks, suggesting the potential for recovery of gray matter trajectories to prior levels of growth if binge drinking levels subside.</span>
<span id="cb1-194"><a href="#cb1-194"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-195"><a href="#cb1-195"></a><span class="fu">### Developmental snares and cascade effects.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-196"><a href="#cb1-196"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-197"><a href="#cb1-197"></a>Normative development can also be upended by experiences (e.g., drug use) that, through various mechanisms, disrupt the normal flow of development wherein each stage establishes a platform for the next. For instance, substance use could lead to association with deviant peers, precluding opportunities for learning various adaptive skills and prosocial behaviors, in effect creating a “snare” that delays psychosocial development, such as maturing out of adolescent antisocial behavior <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@moffitt2015</span><span class="co">]</span>. Relatedly, the consequences of these types of events can cascade (e.g., school dropout, involvement in the criminal justice system) so that the effects of the snare are amplified <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @masten2005; @rogosch2010</span><span class="co">]</span>. Although conceptually distinct from vulnerable periods, both types of developmental considerations highlight the importance of viewing behavior in the context of development and attempting to determine how various developmental pathways unfold. Longitudinal data are crucial in this context to assess individual levels of development prior to and following onset of experiences or other environmental factors; e.g., the ABCD Study collected data starting at ages 9-10 and hence before the onset of substance use for the vast majority of participants.</span>

<span id="cb1-207"><a href="#cb1-207"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-208"><a href="#cb1-208"></a>The hallmark characteristic of longitudinal data analysis is the administration of repeated measurements of the same constructs on assessment targets (e.g., individuals, families) across time. The primary rationale for collecting longitudinal data is to assess within-person change over time, allowing researchers to estimate individual developmental trajectories and the genetic and/or environmental factors that may impact these trajectories. Administering repeated measurements more frequently or over longer time spans enables researchers to ask more nuanced questions and to make stronger inferences.</span>
<span id="cb1-209"><a href="#cb1-209"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-210"><a href="#cb1-210"></a><span class="fu">### Two Time Points versus Three or More.</span></span>
<span id="cb1-211"><a href="#cb1-211"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-212"><a href="#cb1-212"></a>Although the clear leap from cross-sectional to the realm of longitudinal data involves going from one assessment to two or more assessments, there are also notable distinctions in designs based on two-assessment points versus three or more measurement occasions. Just as cross-sectional data can be informative in some situations, two waves of data can be beneficial in contexts such as when experimental manipulation is involved (e.g., pre/post tests), or if the central goal is prediction (e.g., trying to predict scores on Variable A at time T as a function of prior scores on Variable A and Variable B at time T-1). At the same time, data based on two assessments are inherently limited on multiple fronts. As @rogosa1982 noted over forty years ago, “Two waves of data are better than one, but maybe not much better” (p. 744). </span>
<span id="cb1-213"><a href="#cb1-213"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-214"><a href="#cb1-214"></a>These sentiments are reflected in more contemporary recommendations regarding best-practice guidelines for prospective data, which increasingly emphasize the benefits of additional measurement occasions for trajectory estimation, model identification and accurate parameter inferences. It is also consistent with research recommending that developmental studies include three or more assessment points, given it is impossible for data based on two-time points to determine the shape of development (given that linear change is the only estimable form for two assessments waves; <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @duncan2009</span><span class="co">]</span>). Research designs that include three (but preferably more) time points allow for non-linear trajectory estimation and increasingly nuanced analyses that more adequately tease apart sources of variation and covariation among the repeated assessments <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@king2018</span><span class="co">]</span>– a key aspect of developmental research. </span>
<span id="cb1-215"><a href="#cb1-215"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-216"><a href="#cb1-216"></a>To illustrate, developmental theories are useful for understanding patterns of within-individual change over time (discussed in further detail, below); however, two data points provide meager information on change at the person level. This point is further underscored in a recent review of statistical models commonly touted as distinguishing within-individual vs between-individual sources of variance in which the study authors concluded “… researchers are limited when attempting to differentiate these sources of variation in psychological phenomenon when using two waves of data” and perhaps more concerning, “…the models discussed here do not offer a feasible way to overcome these inherent limitations” <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@littlefield2021</span><span class="co">]</span>. It is important to note, however, that despite the current focus on two-wave designs versus three or more assessment waves, garnering three assessment points is not a panacea for longitudinal modeling. Indeed, several contemporary longitudinal models designed to isolate within-individual variability (e.g., the Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals; @curran2014) require at least four assessments to parameterize fully and, more generally, increasingly accurate and nuanced parameter estimates are obtained as more assessment occasions are used <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@duncan2009</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-217"><a href="#cb1-217"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-218"><a href="#cb1-218"></a><span class="fu">### Types of stability and change</span></span>
<span id="cb1-219"><a href="#cb1-219"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-220"><a href="#cb1-220"></a>If one were to try to sum up what developmental trajectories in a living organism are exactly, one could plausibly argue they are the patterns of stability and change in its phenotypes as the organism traverses the life course. Symbolically, developmental trajectories can be expressed as fi(t), a possibly multivariate function of time t, specific to the ith individual and typically taking values in the real numbers for continuous phenotypes and the integers for discrete phenotypes. Ideally, t is a biologically meaningful temporal index (e.g., calendar age) as opposed to an exogenous progression of events (e.g., study visit number). Properties of interest might include rate of change over time, degree of smoothness (e.g., continuously differentiable), shape (e.g., polynomial or asymptotic behavior), how and how much fi(t) differs across individuals, and what factors predict either within-individual variation (at different times) or between-individual variation (either overall or at specific times).</span>
<span id="cb1-221"><a href="#cb1-221"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-222"><a href="#cb1-222"></a>There are a few different ways to think about patterns of stability and change (see Figure 1). Consider measuring school disengagement at the start of middle school and the end of middle school . A common first step may be to compare sixth graders’ average disengagement values and eighth graders’ disengagement values. This comparison of the average scores for the same group of individuals at multiple time points is referred to as “mean-level”, as it provides information about change over time (or lack thereof) for an outcome of interest aggregated across members of a group. In contrast, “between-individual” stability could be assessed, e.g., by calculating the Spearman correlation between the values obtained at different time points (e.g., ‘disengagement in sixth grade’ with ‘disengagement in eighth grade). This analysis focuses on the degree to which individuals retain their relative placement in a group across time. Consider someone who reported the lowest frequencies of disengagement in 6th grade and may report significantly higher disengagement over middle school (i.e., exhibit high levels of change), but report the lowest frequencies of disengagement in eighth grade. That is, the individual is manifesting rank-order stability, even in the context of high mean-level change.</span>
<span id="cb1-223"><a href="#cb1-223"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-224"><a href="#cb1-224"></a>Both types of stability and change are important. Mean-level change in certain traits might help to explain why, in general, populations of individuals tend to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental factors in specific age ranges; rank-order stability might help to quantify the extent to which certain characteristics of the individual are more or less trait-like compared to others. For example, in some areas of development, considerable mean-level change occurs over time (e.g., changes in Big 5 personality traits; @bleidorn2022), but exhibit relatively high rank-order stability, at least over shorter measurement intervals <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@bleidorn2022; @roberts2000; @roberts2006</span><span class="co">]</span>. Despite the useful information afforded by examining mean-level and rank-order stability and change, these approaches are limited in that they provide little information about the overall patterns of within-individual change (i.e., trajectories) and, in turn, can result in fundamental misinterpretations about substantial or meaningful changes in an outcome of interest <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@curran2011</span><span class="co">]</span>. For example, questions related to the impact of early-onset substance use on brain development focus on changes within a given individual (i.e., intraindividual differences). The longitudinal nature of the ABCD Study, which will provide researchers with over ten time points for some constructs (e.g., substance use) across a ten-year period, allows for the study of within-person processes.</span>

<span id="cb1-228"><a href="#cb1-228"></a><span class="fu">### Use of appropriate longitudinal models</span></span>
<span id="cb1-229"><a href="#cb1-229"></a>There is growing recognition that statistical models commonly applied to longitudinal data often fail to align with the developmental theory they are being used to assess <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @curran2011; @hoffman2015; @littlefield2021</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>
<span id="cb1-230"><a href="#cb1-230"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-231"><a href="#cb1-231"></a>First, developmental studies typically involve the use of prospective data to inform theories that are concerned with clear within-person processes (e.g., how phenotypes change or remain stable within individuals over time, <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @curran2011</span><span class="co">]</span>). Despite this, methods generally unsuited for disaggregating between- and within-person effects (e.g., cross-lagged panel models <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">CLPM</span><span class="co">]</span>) remain common within various extant literatures. Fortunately, there exists a range of models that have been proposed to tease apart between- and within-person sources of variance across time <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @littlefield2021; @orth2021</span><span class="co">]</span>. Most of these contemporary alternatives incorporate time-specific latent variables to capture between-person sources of variance and model within-person deviations around an individual’s mean (or trait) level across time (e.g., random-intercept cross-lagged panel model <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">RI-CLPM</span><span class="co">]</span>, @hamaker2015; latent curve models with structured residuals <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">LCM-SR</span><span class="co">]</span>, @curran2014). It is important to note however that these models require multiple assessments waves (e.g., four or more to fully specify the LCM-SR), additional expertise to overcome issues with model convergence, and appreciation of modeling assumptions when attempting to adjudicate among potential models in each research context <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @littlefield2021, for further discussion</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-232"><a href="#cb1-232"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-233"><a href="#cb1-233"></a>Second, many statistical models assume certain characteristics about the data to which they are being applied. Common assumptions of parametric statistical models (e.g., linear mixed-effects models) include normality and equality of variances. These assumptions must be carefully considered before finalizing analytical approaches, so that valid inferences can be made from the data, as violation of a model’s assumptions can substantively invalidate the interpretation of results. For example, longitudinal data can exhibit heterogeneous variability (i.e., the variance of the response changes over the duration of the study) that may need to be accounted for within a model. Another pertinent modeling assumption is whether trajectories are linear or non-linear. With 2-3 assessments per individual, only a linear model of within-person change is usually feasible; with more time points, higher level polynomials or models with more flexible trajectory shapes (e.g., curve smoothing via cubic splines) becomes possible <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">REFs</span><span class="co">]</span>. Note, however, baseline age in the ABCD Study ranges over two full years; for some outcomes it may be desirable to include a (possibly nonlinear) effect of baseline age along with a linear effect of within-person change in age with only 2-3 assessment times <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@thompson2013</span><span class="co">]</span>. As the study progresses and more times points are assessed, nonparametric curve estimation at the mean <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">GAMMs</span><span class="co">]</span> and at the individual level may also become useful <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@ramsay2002</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>

<span id="cb1-235"><a href="#cb1-235"></a><span class="fu">### Continuous and Discrete Outcomes</span></span>
<span id="cb1-236"><a href="#cb1-236"></a>Implementing valid and efficient statistical models requires an understanding of the type of data being analyzed. For example, repeated assessments within the ABCD Study can be based on continuous or discrete measures. Examples of discrete measures include repeated assessments of binary variables (e.g., past 12-month alcohol use disorder status measured across ten years), ordinal variables (e.g., caregiver-reported items measuring emotional and behavioral concerns via the Child Behavior Checklist including the categories of “Not True”, “Somewhat True”, and “Very True”), and count variables (e.g., number of cigarettes smoked per day). In many ways, the distributional assumptions of indicators used in longitudinal designs mirror the decision points and considerations when delineating across different types of discrete outcome variables, a topic that spans entire textbooks <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., see @lenz2016</span><span class="co">]</span>. For example, the Mplus manual <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@muthen2017</span><span class="co">]</span> includes examples of a) censored and censored-inflated models, b) linear growth models for binary or ordinal variables, c) linear growth models for a count outcome assuming a Poisson model, and d) linear growth models for a count outcome assuming a zero-inflated Poisson model. Beyond these highlighted examples, other distributions (e.g., negative binomial) can be assumed for the indicators when modeling longitudinal data <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@ren2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. These models can account for issues that can occur when working with discrete outcomes, including overdispersion <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">when the variance is higher than would be expected based on a given distribution; see @lenz2016</span><span class="co">]</span>. Given the sheer breadth of issues relevant to determining better models for discrete outcomes, it is not uncommon for texts on longitudinal data analysis to only cover models and approaches that assume continuous variables <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @little2013</span><span class="co">]</span>. However, some textbooks on categorical data analysis provide more detailed coverage of the myriad issues and modeling choices to consider when working with discrete outcomes <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @lenz2016, Chapter 11 for matched pair/two-assessment designs; Chapter 12 for marginal and transitional models for repeated designs, such as generalized estimating equations, and Chapter 13 for random effects models for discrete outcomes</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>

<span id="cb1-238"><a href="#cb1-238"></a><span class="fu">### Issues in attributing longitudinal change to development</span></span>
<span id="cb1-239"><a href="#cb1-239"></a>One can observe systematic changes over time in a variable of interest and assume this change is attributable to development. However, various pitfalls with longitudinal data can complicate or even invalidate this conclusion. For example, if data missingness or participant dropout are related to the values of the outcome, changing sample composition as the study progresses can bias mean trajectory estimates (we describe this in more detail in Section 3.1.7 below). Another prerequisite for valid developmental interpretations of longitudinal data is to establish whether a construct is measured consistently over time, i.e., longitudinal measurement invariance <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@liu2017; @van2015; @willoughby2012</span><span class="co">]</span>. Establishing longitudinal measurement invariance provides researchers with greater confidence that any change over time identified for a construct is attributable to individual change rather than a measurement artifact. For example, one study using data from the ABCD Study [@brislin2023) found differential item functioning in two items from a brief delinquency measure, revealing significant bias in an arrest item across Black and White youth. More specifically, Black youth were more likely to report being arrested compared to White youth with similar levels of delinquency. Prevalence rates of delinquent behavior would have been severely biased if measurement invariance had not been tested.</span>
<span id="cb1-240"><a href="#cb1-240"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-241"><a href="#cb1-241"></a>Observed patterns of growth and decline often differ between cross-sectional vs. longitudinal effects <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@salthouse2014</span><span class="co">]</span> where subjects gain increasing experience with the assessment with each successive measurement occasion. Such experience effects on cognitive functioning have been demonstrated in adolescent longitudinal samples similar to ABCD <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@sullivan2017</span><span class="co">]</span> and highlight the need to consider these effects and address them analytically. In the case of performance-based measures <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., matrix reasoning related to neurocognitive functioning; see @salthouse2014</span><span class="co">]</span>, this can be due to “learning” the task from previous test administrations (e.g., someone taking the test a second time performs better than they did the first time simply as a function of having taken it before). Even in the case of non-performance-based measures (e.g., levels of depression), where one cannot easily make the argument that one has acquired some task-specific skill through learning, it has been observed that respondents tend to endorse lower levels on subsequent assessments <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @beck1961; @french2010</span><span class="co">]</span> and this phenomenon has been well documented in research using structured diagnostic interviews <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@robins1985</span><span class="co">]</span>. While it is typically assumed that individuals are rescinding or telling us less information on follow-up interviews, there is reason to suspect that in some cases the initial assessment may be artefactually elevated <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @shrout2018</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>
<span id="cb1-242"><a href="#cb1-242"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-243"><a href="#cb1-243"></a>Some longitudinal studies, e.g., accelerated longitudinal designs <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">ALDs; @thompson2011</span><span class="co">]</span> are especially well suited for discovering these effects and modeling them. While ABCD is not an ALD, the variability in age (and grade in school) at the time of baseline recruitment (9 years, 0 months to 10 years, 11 months) allows some measures, collected every year, to be conceptualized as an ALD (e.g., substance use; prosocial behavior; family conflict; screen time). It is possible that in later waves, analyses will allow for disaggregating the confounded effects of age and the number of prior assessments. However, ABCD is fundamentally a single-cohort, longitudinal design, wherein number of prior assessments and age are mostly confounded, and for, perhaps, most analyses, the possible influence of experience effects needs to be kept in mind.</span>

<span id="cb1-245"><a href="#cb1-245"></a><span class="fu">### Covariance Structures</span></span>
<span id="cb1-246"><a href="#cb1-246"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-247"><a href="#cb1-247"></a>A central issue for repeated measurements on an individual is how to account for the correlated nature of the data. Traditional techniques, such as a standard regression or ANOVA model, assume residuals are independent and thus are inappropriate for designs that assess the same individuals across time. That is, given that residuals are no longer independent, the standard errors from the models are biased and can produce misleading inferential results. Although there are formal tests of independence for time series data (e.g., the Durbin-Watson statistic <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@durbin1950</span><span class="co">]</span>, more commonly, independence is assumed to be violated in study designs with repeated assessments. Therefore, an initial question to be addressed by a researcher analyzing prospective data is how to best model the covariance structure of said data.</span>
<span id="cb1-248"><a href="#cb1-248"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-249"><a href="#cb1-249"></a>Statistical models for longitudinal data include two main components to account for assumptions that are commonly violated when working with repeated measures data: a model for the covariance among repeated measures (involving the covariance among pairs of repeated outcomes on an individual), coupled with a model for the mean response and its dependence on covariates (e.g., sex at birth). There exists a range of methods to model covariance structures, each with its own set of tradeoffs between model fit and parsimony and which may be more or less appropriate for each specific application <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., see @kincaid2005</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-250"><a href="#cb1-250"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-251"><a href="#cb1-251"></a>There are various approaches to adjust models for the lack of independence of residuals across time, be it for data with repeated assessments or other situations with so-called nested data (e.g., children nested within schools; siblings nested within families). The most common approach is to use random effects. Essentially, random effects allow for variance estimates around fixed effects. A classic example (from @bryk1992; @singer1998) involves math achievement measured among students nested within schools. In a basic, intercept-only model with no covariates, there would be one fixed effect (the grand mean, or intercept, of math achievement) and two random effects (one representing variation in the intercept, or the variation between schools, and another for the within-school residual, or how much variance in math achievement is left over after taking into account nesting in school). From this framework, each student’s score would be a function of the fixed effect (the overall mean), the variation in scores that exists between schools, and the variation that exists among students within the same school. Assumptions about the variance and covariance components of this model dictate the form of the variance/covariance structure. For example, if we assume the random effects are independent (i.e., uncorrelated), the implied structure would be compound symmetry, where it is assumed the covariance of any two students in a single class is represented by a random effect (the variance between school means) and the covariance of any two students in different classes is zero. The assumptions of this relatively simple covariance structure can be relaxed, resulting in different covariance structures with additional parameters (see @singer1998). </span>
<span id="cb1-252"><a href="#cb1-252"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-253"><a href="#cb1-253"></a>In a similar fashion, individual growth models could be fit to a series of repeated assessments, where assessments are nested within individuals. For example, an unconditional linear growth model would involve two fixed effects – one for the intercept (an estimate of the average score when time is coded zero) and one for the linear slope (an estimate of the change in scores for each unit increase in time). Random effects could include a random effect for intercept (or an estimate of the variation in scores when time is coded as zero), a random effect for the linear slope (or an estimate of the variation in linear change across time), and a random effect for the within-person residual (or an estimate of the left over variance, or residual, of a given assessment when accounting for the intercept and linear slope). Assumptions regarding the covariation among the random effects also indicate different covariance structures. For example, it is typical to assume the random intercept and random slope components covary (e.g., if time is coded such that the first time point = zero, the covariance estimate suggests that an individual’s score at baseline relates to the amount of change exhibited across time). Further, particularly in structural equation model forms of this model, it is typically assumed the random effect for the within-person residual varies across assessments (@curran2003).</span>
<span id="cb1-254"><a href="#cb1-254"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-255"><a href="#cb1-255"></a>One alternative structure that attempts to handle the reality that correlations between repeated assessments tend to diminish across time is the autoregressive design. As the name implies, the structure assumes a subsequent measurement occasion (e.g., assessment at Wave 2) is regressed onto (that is, is predicted by) a prior measurement occasion (e.g., assessment at Wave 1). The most common type of autoregressive design is the AR(1), where assessments at time T + 1 are regressed on assessments at Time T. Identical to compound symmetry, this model assumes the variances are homogenous across time. Diverting from compound symmetry, this model assumes the correlations between repeated assessments decline exponentially across measurement occasions rather than remaining constant. That is, we can think of the underlying process as a stochastic one that wears itself out over time. For example, per the AR(1) structure, if the correlation between Time 1 and Time 2 data is thought to be .5, then the correlation between Time 1 and Time 3 data would be assumed to be .5 × .5 = .25, and the correlation between Time 1 and Time 4 data would be assumed to be .5 × .5 × .5 = .125. As with compound symmetry, the basic AR(1) model is parsimonious in that it only requires two parameters (the variance of the assessments and the autoregressive coefficient). Notably, the assumption of constant autoregressive relations between assessments is often relaxed in commonly employed designs that use autoregressive modeling (e.g., cross-lagged panel models <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">CLPM</span><span class="co">]</span>). These designs still typically assume an AR(1) process (e.g., it is sufficient to regress the Time 3 assessment onto the Time 2 assessment and is not necessary to also regress the Time 3 assessment onto the Time 1 assessment, which would result in an AR(2) process). However, the magnitude of these relations is often allowed to differ across different AR(1) pairs of assessment (e.g., the relation between Time 1 and Time 2 can be different from the relation between Time 2 and Time 3). These more commonly employed models also often relax the assumption of equal variances of the repeated assessments. Although the AR(1) structure may involve a more realistic set of assumptions compared to compound symmetry, in that the AR(1) model allows for diminishing correlations across time, the basic AR(1) model, as well as autoregressive models more generally, can also suffer from several limitations in contexts that are common in prospective designs. In particular, recent work demonstrates that if a construct being assessed prospectively across time is trait-like in nature, then a simple AR(1) process fail to adequately account for this trait-like structure, with the downstream consequence that estimates derived from models based on AR structures (such as the CLPM) can be misleading and fail to adequately demarcate between- vs. within-person sources of variance <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@hamaker2015</span><span class="co">]</span>. Finally, it is also worth noting that in many longitudinal contexts, the time intervals between assessments are not equidistant and researchers need to consider carefully how to appropriately model time in their model and what this model implies.</span>

<span id="cb1-258"><a href="#cb1-258"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-259"><a href="#cb1-259"></a>Attrition from a longitudinal panel study such as ABCD is inevitable and represents a potential threat to the validity of longitudinal analyses and cross-sectional analyses conducted at later time points, especially since attrition can only be expected to grow over time<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@littlefield2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. The ABCD Retention Workgroup (RW) employs a data-driven approach to examine, track, and intervene in these issues and while preliminary findings show participant race and parent education level to be associated with late and missing visits, although to date, attrition in ABCD has been minimal <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@ewing2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. Ideally, one tries to minimize attrition through good retention practices from the outset via strategies designed to maintain engagement in the project <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@cotter2005; @hill2016; @watson2018</span><span class="co">]</span>. However, even the best-executed studies need to anticipate growing attrition over the length of the study and implement analytic strategies designed to provide the most valid inferences. Perhaps the most key concern when dealing with data that is missing due to attrition is determining the degree of bias in retained variables that is a consequence of attrition. Such bias can attenuate generalizability, particularly if the pattern of missingness is not random (e.g., certain subsets of the population are more likely to drop out/not attend a visit). Assuming that the data are not missing completely at random, attention to the nature of the missingness and employing techniques designed to mitigate attrition-related biases need to be considered in all longitudinal analyses.</span>
<span id="cb1-260"><a href="#cb1-260"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-261"><a href="#cb1-261"></a>Three types of missingness are considered in the literature <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @little1989</span><span class="co">]</span>, namely: a) missing completely at random (MCAR), b) missing at random (MAR), and c) missing not at random (MNAR). Data that are MCAR are a simple random sample of all data in a given dataset. MAR implies missing data are a random sample (i.e., does not hinge on some unmeasured variables) within strata of the measured covariates in a dataset (e.g., biological sex). Data that are MNAR are missing as a function of unobserved variables and may bias assocations even after conditioning on the observed covariates. @graham2009 provides an excellent and easy-to-digest overview of further details involving missing data considerations.</span>
<span id="cb1-262"><a href="#cb1-262"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-263"><a href="#cb1-263"></a>Modern approaches for handling missing data, such as full information maximum likelihood, propensity weighting, auxiliary variables and multiple imputation avoid the biases of older approaches <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @enders2010; @graham2009</span><span class="co">]</span>. @graham2009 noted several “myths” regarding missing data. For example, Graham notes many assume the data must be minimally MAR to permit estimating procedures (such as maximum likelihood or multiple imputation) compared to other, more traditional approaches (e.g., using only complete case data). Violations of MAR impact both traditional and more modern data estimation procedures, though as noted by Graham, violations of MAR tend to have a greater effect on older methods. Graham thus suggests that imputing missing data is a better approach compared to listwise deletion in most circumstances, regardless of the model of missingness <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">i.e., MCAR, MAR, MNAR; see @graham2009</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>

<span id="cb1-266"><a href="#cb1-266"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-267"><a href="#cb1-267"></a>Given that longitudinal data involve multiple sources of variance, quantifying effect sizes longitudinally is a more difficult task compared to deriving such estimates from cross-sectional data. An effect size can be defined as, “a population parameter (estimated in a sample) encapsulating the practical or clinical importance of a phenomenon under study.” <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@kraemer2014</span><span class="co">]</span>. Common effect size metrics include the correlation r between two variables and the standardized difference between two means, Cohen’s *d* <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@cohen1988</span><span class="co">]</span>. An extensive discussion of effect sizes and their relevance for ABCD is given in @dick2021. Adjustments to common effect size calculations, such as Cohen’s d, are required even when only two time points are considered (e.g., @morris2002]. @wang2019 note there are multiple approaches to obtaining standardized within-person effects, and that commonly suggested approaches (e.g., global standardization) can be problematic <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @wang2019, for more details</span><span class="co">]</span>. Thus, obtaining effect size metrics based on standardized estimates that are relatively simple in cross-sectional data (such as r) becomes more complex in the context of prospective longitudinal data. @feingold2009 noted that equations for effects sizes used in studies involving growth modeling analysis (e.g., latent growth curve modeling) were not mathematically equivalent, and the effect sizes were not in the same metric as effect sizes from traditional analysis <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">see @feingold2009, for more details</span><span class="co">]</span>. Given this issue, there have been various proposals for adjusting effect size measures in repeated assessments. @feingold2019 reviews the approach for effect size metrics for analyses based on growth modeling, including when considering linear and non-linear (i.e., quadratic) growth factors. @morris2002 review various equations for effect size calculations relevant to combining estimates in meta-analysis with repeated measures and independent-groups designs. Other approaches to quantifying effect sizes longitudinally may be based on standardized estimates from models that more optimally disentangle between- and within-person sources of variance. As an example, within a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) framework, standardized estimates between random intercepts (i.e., the correlation between two random intercepts for two different constructs assessed repeatedly) could be used to index the between-person relation, whereas standardized estimates among the structured residuals could be used as informing the effect sizes of within-person relations.</span>

To accommodate various research questions and contexts, different types of longitudinal data and data structures have emerged (see Figure **X**). An understanding of these data structures is helpful, as they can warrant different types of longitudinal data analysis (LDA). Given that identifying a starting point for making comparisons is somewhat arbitrary, Curran and Bauer [2019; @bauer2019] provide a nice on-ramp in first distinguishing between the use of “time-to-event” and “repeated measures” data. Although both model time, the former is concerned with whether and when an event occurs, whereas the later is focused on growth and change [@bauer2019]. Time-to-event structures measure time from a well-defined origin point up to the occurrence of an event of interest. This data structure is most often analyzed using survival analysis methods (e.g., hazard rate models, event history analysis, failure-time models) and the time-to-event data can be based on a single assessment or include multiple recurrent or competing events. While much has been written about “time-to-event” data (**see xxx; xxx; xxxx**), including a recent analysis examining exclusionary discipline in schools using data from the ABCD Study (@brislin2023), our emphasis will be given to the modeling of “repeated measures” data.</span>

<span id="cb1-274"><a href="#cb1-274"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-275"><a href="#cb1-275"></a>When discussing longitudinal analysis, we are most often talking about data collected on the same unit (e.g., individuals) across multiple measurement occasions. However, repeated-measures analysis is not a monolith, and it will serve us well to distinguish between a few of the most common types. One such approach to repeated measures analysis is the use of time-series models. These models generally consist of a long sequence of repeated measurements (≧ 50-100 measurements) on a single (or small number of) variable of interest. Time-series analysis is often used to predict/forecast temporal trends and cyclic patterns and is geared toward making inferences about prospective outcomes within a population (with relatively with less focus on inferring individual-level mechanisms and risk factors). A related type of repeated measures analysis is Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD). Similar to time-series analysis, ILD models involve frequent measurements (~ 30-40 measurements) of the same individuals in a relatively circumspect period of time (e.g., experience sampling to obtain time series on many individuals). Although ILD models may include slightly fewer measurement occasions than time-series data, ILD models tend to have more subjects than time series models (~ 50-100 subjects). This allows ILD models to examine short-term patterns by incorporating a time series model that can sometimes fit parameter estimates to each individual’s data in order to model individual difference outcomes. The final type of repeated measures analysis that we will primarily focus on is the longitudinal panel model. These models follow a group of individuals— a panel (also referred to as a cohort) — across relatively fewer measurement occassions (~ 5-15), and are often interested in examining change across both, within-individuals and between-individuals.</span>

<span id="cb1-277"><a href="#cb1-277"></a>While other longitudinal designs have their own unique strengths and applications, the longitudinal panel design is particularly well-suited for investigating developmental processes in the context of the ABCD Study. In the following sections, we will discuss various analytic methods commonly used to analyze longitudinal panel data, including growth models, mixed models, and a number of additional trajectory models. These methods provide valuable insights into within- and between-individual differences and are highly relevant for researchers working with the ABCD Study dataset. By focusing on these methods, we aim to equip readers with the knowledge necessary to conduct longitudinal research and perform analyses using the rich, longitudinal, and publicly available data from the ABCD Study.</span>

<span id="cb1-284"><a href="#cb1-284"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-285"><a href="#cb1-285"></a>With the large and continually expanding body of research on statistical methods for longitudinal analyses, determining which longitudinal model to implement can be challenging. The aim of this section is to help researchers navigate these many options to identify the statistical approach most appropriate to their unique research question when deciding on how to measure change over time. Notably, there are a myriad of viable ways one can go about grouping various types of longitudinal models for presentation. </span>
<span id="cb1-286"><a href="#cb1-286"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-287"><a href="#cb1-287"></a>Common examples include grouping by linear vs nonlinear models <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@collins2006</span><span class="co">]</span>, the number of measurement occasions <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@king2018</span><span class="co">]</span>, and statistical equivalency <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., change scores vs. residualized change; see @castro-schilo2018</span><span class="co">]</span>. The organization we use below overlaps in a number of ways with these examples, and in particular with @bauer2019. However, it is important to note that in each case, the chosen way of grouping is primarily intended to allow the reader to compare and contrast various analytical approaches. In the following sections, we briefly summarize the advantages/disadvantages of a series of longitudinal models organized into the following groupings: Traditional Models, Modern GLM Extensions, SEM, and Advanced SEM. We note that this is not an exhaustive review of each of these methods, and for more in-depth detail we do provide the reader with relevant resources. As aptly summarized by @bauer2019, “there are many exceptions, alternatives, nuances, ‘what ifs’, and ‘but couldn’t you’s that aren’t addressed here.”</span>

<span id="cb1-290"><a href="#cb1-290"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-291"><a href="#cb1-291"></a><span class="fu">#### Traditional Models</span></span>
<span id="cb1-292"><a href="#cb1-292"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-293"><a href="#cb1-293"></a>Traditional methods for longitudinal analysis primarily focus on modeling mean-level change, and how these changes may differ across groups or levels of some other variable. For example, is there a difference in average internalizing symptoms obtained across multiple assessments between boys and girls? Longitudinal models that focus on mean-level change are also referred to as marginal models and examples of specific methods include repeated measures ANOVA (and MANOVA), ANCOVA, and Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs). Mean-level change models are commonly used when data is only available from 2 measurement occasions. For example, computing a difference score (e.g., mean internalizing scores at time 2 - mean internalizing scores at time 1) that can be used as an outcome in a subsequent GLM analysis (e.g., paired-samples t-test, repeated measures ANOVA) to test for differences in patterns of change over time and between groups. Additionally, the longitudinal signed-rank test, a nonparametric alternative to the paired t-test, can be a useful tool for analyzing non-normal paired data. Another common approach, often used in pre-/post-design studies but can be used with ABCD Study data, is to use residualized change score analysis to assess the degree of change in a variable, while controlling for its initial level <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@castro-schilo2018</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>
<span id="cb1-294"><a href="#cb1-294"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-295"><a href="#cb1-295"></a>For example, to examine change in cortico-limbic connectivity among ABCD participants, @brieant2021 regressed cortico-limbic connectivity at the year 2 follow-up on baseline cortico-limbic connectivity, which allowed the authors to examine the associations between negative life events and the variance of cortico-limbic connectivity unexplained by baseline connectivity. Similarly, @romer2021 used a residualized-change model to examine the bidirectional influences of executive functioning and a general psychopathology factor ‘p’ across the first two years of the ABCD Study. Both studies were able to conclude associations between their constructs of interest that could not be accounted for by prior frequencies at baseline.</span>
<span id="cb1-296"><a href="#cb1-296"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-297"><a href="#cb1-297"></a>Traditional longitudinal, such as residualized chance score models, can be useful in some contexts (e.g., two measurement occasions), but overall, their practical utility for answering questions about developmental processes is limited. Perhaps most notably, these models do not allow for characterizing patterns of within-person change. This is a particularly important limitation since most psychological theories posit within-person processes (i.e., what will happen within a given individual). As such, traditional approaches often correspond poorly with most theoretical models of change and a failure to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects can result in consequential errors of inference <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., ecological fallacy, @curran2011</span><span class="co">]</span>. Moreover, even determining which of these procedures to use for comparing change over two time points across groups can be surprisingly complicated. A particularly vexing example is that of imbalanced baseline scores (i.e., when baseline scores are correlated with a covariate of interest), which can produce different conclusions across methods <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., **X versus X**; see @littlefield2023, for a review</span><span class="co">]</span>. Given these shortcomings, and the complexity of the issues surrounding some of these methods, it is typically recommended that researchers make use of more modern approaches for analyzing longitudinal data (and preferably make use of data collected across three or more time points, as is currently true for many ABCD assessments).</span>
<span id="cb1-298"><a href="#cb1-298"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-299"><a href="#cb1-299"></a><span class="fu">#### Modern GLM Extensions</span></span>
<span id="cb1-300"><a href="#cb1-300"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-301"><a href="#cb1-301"></a>Modern approaches to longitudinal data analysis have advanced beyond traditional methods by offering greater flexibility and a more in-depth understanding of within-person and between-person variability. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), Linear Mixed Models (LMM), Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), and Autoregressive Cross-Lagged Panel Models (ARCL) are examples of such contemporary techniques. GEE, an extension of Generalized Linear Models, combines the generalized linear model for non-normal outcomes with repeated measures (marginal) model and is suitable for analyzing correlated longitudinal data and modeling population-averaged effects. For example, @vandijk2021 used GEE to obtain relative risks for psychiatric diagnoses among children in the ABCD Study with a family history of depression and used the ABCD Study sampling weights to generalize prevalence rates among 9 and 10 year-olds across the US. LMMs, also known as multilevel or hierarchical linear models, facilitate the simultaneous analysis of within-person and between-person variability, making them ideal for nested data structures or repeated measures. Within the ABCD Study, reseachers may want to consider nesting by individual, family (i.e., siblings or twins), school or district, and/or site. GLMMs further extend the LMM framework to accommodate non-normal response variables, such as binary, count, or ordinal data, such as the use of ABCD data on substance use <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">e.g., @martz2022</span><span class="co">]</span> screen media use <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lees2020</span><span class="co">]</span>, and microstructure of the brain <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@palmer2022</span><span class="co">]</span>. Finally, ARCL models are used to investigate reciprocal relationships between variables over time, as they estimate both autoregressive and cross-lagged effects <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">although, ARCL models are relatively less useful for teasing apart between-person and within-person sources of variances; see @curran2021</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-302"><a href="#cb1-302"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-303"><a href="#cb1-303"></a>The strengths of these modern methods lie in their ability to account for individual differences, within-person change, and time-varying predictors, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex relationships in longitudinal data. Despite these advantages, modern approaches may require more complex modeling assumptions and higher computational demands compared to traditional methods. Additionally, proper model specification and the interpretation of results can be more challenging, especially in cases of high multicollinearity or missing data. However, modern longitudinal analysis methods have generally surpassed traditional methods in addressing a wider range of research questions, accommodating diverse data structures, and elucidating the intricate dynamics of developmental processes.</span>
<span id="cb1-304"><a href="#cb1-304"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-305"><a href="#cb1-305"></a><span class="fu">#### SEM</span></span>
<span id="cb1-306"><a href="#cb1-306"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-307"><a href="#cb1-307"></a>Structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches have gained prominence in longitudinal data analysis due to their ability to estimate complex relationships among observed and latent variables while accounting for measurement error. SEM techniques can be categorized into variable-centered, person-centered, and hybrid approaches, each with unique strengths and limitations. The choice of method depends on the research question, data structure, and underlying assumptions.</span>
<span id="cb1-308"><a href="#cb1-308"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-309"><a href="#cb1-309"></a>Variable-centered approaches, such as latent change scores, latent growth curve models, multivariate (parallel process) latent growth curve models, and latent state-trait models, focus on examining relationships among variables and population-level patterns. These models offer a powerful means to estimate individual change trajectories and the relationships between growth parameters of different variables, while also decomposing observed measurements into latent state and trait components. However, these approaches may not adequately capture distinct subgroups of individuals who share similar patterns of change over time, which can be crucial for understanding heterogeneous developmental processes.</span>
<span id="cb1-310"><a href="#cb1-310"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-311"><a href="#cb1-311"></a>Person-centered approaches, including latent transition analysis and latent class growth analysis, address this limitation by identifying subgroups of individuals who share similar patterns of change. These models can reveal meaningful subpopulations and help researchers understand the factors that contribute to differences in developmental trajectories. For example, taking advantage of the large sample size of the ABCD Study, @xiang2022 found evidence of four subgroups of youth with unique longitudinal patterns of depressive symptoms over time and identified risk factors that were differentially associated with the various trajectories. The use of such models allows for a more nuanced understanding of the associations between risk factors and change in symptomatology, as opposed to a snapshot of symptomatology at a single time point. Despite a range of potential model specifications for longitudinal mixture modeling, person-centered approaches tend to use parameterizations that default to settings found in popular software packages (e.g., Mplus). It has recently been demonstrated (see @mcneish2021) that the use of such specifications tends to identify the so-called “cat’s cradle” solution (see @sher2011) that consists of “…(a) a consistently ‘low’ group, (b) an ‘increase’ group, (c) a ‘decrease’ group, and (d) a consistently ‘high’ group” (@sher2011, p. 322). Indeed, @xiang2022 describe their four-group solution as follows: “Of all participants, 536 (10.80%) were classified as increasing, 269 (5.42%) as persistently high, 433 (8.73%) as decreasing, and 3724 (75.05%) as persistently low” (@xiang2022, p. 162). Although @sher2011 cautioned that groups from these trajectory-based approaches should not be over-reified, this practice also remains common (e.g., @hawes2016; @hawes2018). Thus, though person-centered approaches can, in theory, help researchers understand the factors that contribute to differences in developmental trajectories, researchers should more thoughtfully consider alternative specifications (see @littlefield2010, as an example) and be especially skeptical when default specifications identify these four prototypic groups.</span>
<span id="cb1-312"><a href="#cb1-312"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-313"><a href="#cb1-313"></a>Hybrid approaches, such as growth mixture modeling, combine aspects of both variable-centered and person-centered models, allowing for the identification of latent subgroups while also modeling relationships among growth parameters. This combination provides a more comprehensive understanding of longitudinal data by capturing both within- and between-person variability. However, hybrid models can be more complex, necessitating careful model specification, selection, and interpretation. Additionally, these methods may require larger sample sizes to ensure the stability and accuracy of results.</span>
<span id="cb1-314"><a href="#cb1-314"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-315"><a href="#cb1-315"></a>In summary, SEM approaches offer powerful tools for longitudinal data analysis, enabling researchers to investigate complex relationships, individual differences, and change dynamics over time. The choice between variable-centered, person-centered, and hybrid approaches depends on the research objectives and the nature of the data. Despite their limitations, these models have greatly advanced our understanding of developmental processes and the factors that contribute to individual differences in change trajectories.</span>
<span id="cb1-316"><a href="#cb1-316"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-317"><a href="#cb1-317"></a><span class="fu">#### Advanced SEM</span></span>
<span id="cb1-318"><a href="#cb1-318"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-319"><a href="#cb1-319"></a>Advanced structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches, such as the RI-CLPM and LCM-SR models, have emerged to address more complex research questions and data structures in longitudinal analysis. These advanced models extend traditional SEM techniques, enabling researchers to disentangle within-person and between-person effects, as well as capture additional time-specific dependencies and associations that may not be accounted for by the latent growth factors.</span>
<span id="cb1-320"><a href="#cb1-320"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-321"><a href="#cb1-321"></a>The RI-CLPM enhances the traditional cross-lagged panel model by incorporating random intercepts, which allow for the separation of stable individual differences from the dynamic within-person associations between variables over time. Within-person variance in these models are captured by a series of latent variables that reflect time specific variance (i.e., the residual variance from the random intercept). These time-specific variables are referred to as structured residuals. Distinguishing between-person variance subsumed by the random intercept from the structured residuals is particularly valuable for understanding the time-specific effects of one variable on another, while accounting for the influence of individual differences. However, RI-CLPM may require larger sample sizes to ensure stability and accuracy of the estimates and can be computationally demanding. Using three waves of ABCD Study data, @kulisch2022 found a prospective association between psychopathology and childhood obesity as well as between childhood obesity and later eating behavior. The authors also showed that reciprocal associations were overestimated when stable, interindividual trait differences was not included in the model (i.e., via the random intercept).</span>
<span id="cb1-322"><a href="#cb1-322"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-323"><a href="#cb1-323"></a>LCM-SR, on the other hand, extends the RI-CLPM by including additional growth factors, such as a random linear slope. That is, the LCM-SR is a hybrid between a latent growth model and CLPM. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of within-person change dynamics and factors influencing change over time. By including structured residuals, LCM-SR can capture additional time-specific relationships that are not explained by the latent growth factors. However, even more so than the RI-CLPM, LCM-SR comes with increased model complexity and requires careful specification and interpretation.</span>
<span id="cb1-324"><a href="#cb1-324"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-325"><a href="#cb1-325"></a>In conclusion, advanced SEM approaches for longitudinal data analysis provide valuable tools for addressing complex research questions and data structures. While they offer more nuanced insights into within-person change dynamics and the influence of individual differences, these models also come with certain limitations, such as the necessity of multiple assessments (e.g., four or more for LCM-SR), increased complexity, computational demands, and the need for careful model specification and interpretation. As with any statistical method, researchers should carefully consider their research objectives, data characteristics, and the assumptions of each model when selecting the most appropriate advanced SEM approach for longitudinal analysis. Given that these modeling approaches necessitate more waves of data, they are not yet commonly used with ABCD Study data. We anticipate that as more waves of ABCD data are publically released, these models can be used to address some of the pitfalls of the more traditional methods.</span>

<span id="cb1-333"><a href="#cb1-333"></a>As we enter the era of large-scale longitudinal investigations, it is essential to critically examine the various analytical methods that can be employed to glean insights from these rich datasets. The complex nature of longitudinal data demands sophisticated and well-suited methodologies to accurately address research questions and minimize biases. This paper aimed to provide an overview of diverse longitudinal analysis techniques, with a particular emphasis on their application to extensive longitudinal studies such as the ABCD Study. Beyond contributing to the ever-growing body of knowledge on longitudinal data analysis, we hope this manuscript also serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to optimize the use of large-scale longitudinal investigations in advancing our understanding of human development and behavior. In this discussion, we will focus on the key findings and recommendations of our review and discuss potential innovations that can further enhance the utility of these methods.</span>
<span id="cb1-334"><a href="#cb1-334"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-335"><a href="#cb1-335"></a>We began by addressing fundamental concepts and considerations in longitudinal research that are essential for generating accurate and meaningful insights into developmental processes. Concepts such as vulnerable periods, developmental disturbances and snares, or cascade and experience effects (among many others), are instrumental in shaping the design, analysis, and interpretation of longitudinal studies. Together, these concepts provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the course of development, while also accounting for the complex interplay between individual development and the influence of environmental factors. By considering the intricate relationships among these factors, researchers can better identify the critical time periods, situations, and contexts that contribute to individual differences in developmental outcomes. This awareness enables more precise inferences regarding the causal relationships between exposures and outcomes, ultimately leading to more robust and meaningful findings that can help facilitate the translation of research findings into practical applications in clinical and public health settings.</span>
<span id="cb1-336"><a href="#cb1-336"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-337"><a href="#cb1-337"></a>We also discussed some of the opportunities, challenges, and pitfalls that arise when working with longitudinal data. Key issues include selecting appropriate methods to account for the intricacies of longitudinal data, addressing missing data in a way that minimizes biases, and determining suitable longitudinal data structures that align with research questions and context. To address these challenges, researchers should carefully consider issues such as study design, selection of methods that account for both within- and between-person sources of variance, and employing modern techniques, (e.g., FIML, multiple imputation) for handling missing data. By adhering to best practices in longitudinal research and remaining vigilant of potential pitfalls, researchers can effectively harness the power of longitudinal data to maximize the potential of their investigations and gain valuable insights into complex developmental processes, individual differences, and the underlying mechanisms that drive change over time.</span>
<span id="cb1-338"><a href="#cb1-338"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-339"><a href="#cb1-339"></a>The final section, along with associated code and additional resources made available as online supplements (), aims to serve as a resource for researchers seeking to understand and implement various longitudinal panel models. By providing an overview of different approaches, their strengths and limitations, and key considerations for their use, we hope to facilitate the selection of appropriate models tailored to specific research questions and data structures. It is essential for researchers to consider their research objectives, the characteristics of their data, and the assumptions underlying each model when choosing the most suitable approach for longitudinal analysis. We encourage researchers to consult the cited literature and online supplements for further guidance in selecting and implementing longitudinal models when using the ABCD Study dataset. As the field continues to advance, we anticipate the emergence of new methods and refinements to existing approaches, further expanding the toolkit available to researchers for the analysis of longitudinal data. By staying informed about developments in this area and critically evaluating the appropriateness of different models for their research questions, researchers can ensure that their longitudinal analyses are both rigorous and informative. Notably, in this vast and continually evolving field, with numerous models and approaches available to address a wide range of research questions, no single model is universally applicable or without limitations. The diversity of methods ensures that researchers can find an appropriate tool for their specific needs. By familiarizing themselves with the various types of longitudinal models, researchers can more effectively navigate the complexities of longitudinal data and contribute valuable insights into the developmental processes and individual differences that shape human experience.</span>
