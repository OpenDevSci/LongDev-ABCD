# Working with Issues in midFEMA

Welcome to the midFEMA project! Issues are a big part of our collaborative environment. They allow us to track tasks, enhance our project, address bugs, and discuss new features. This guide will help you understand how to effectively use issues for contributing to the project.

## :mag: Finding Issues to Work On

Before starting work, please browse our [open issues](https://github.com/openresearchcollabs/midFEMA/issues) to find something that interests you. Use labels such as `🐛 bug` or `good first issue` to filter for issues that might be a good match for your expertise or interest level.

- **Good First Issues**: If you're new to the project, look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/openresearchcollabs/midFEMA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These are typically simpler tasks designed to get you familiar with the project workflow.
- **Bug Fixes**: If you're interested in fixing bugs, search for issues labeled [`🐛 bug`](https://github.com/openresearchcollabs/midFEMA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%90%9B+bug%22).

## 📝 Using Issue Templates

To maintain consistency and ensure that all necessary information is provided, we use issue templates for different kinds of contributions:

1. **Creating a New Issue**: Navigate to our [Issue Templates Page](https://github.com/openresearchcollabs/midFEMA/issues/new/choose) and select the template that best matches the type of issue you're reporting or suggestion you're making.
2. **Filling Out the Template**: Provide as much detail as possible within the template to help us understand the context and specifics of your issue or suggestion.

## 🚀 Taking an Issue

If you want to work on an open issue:
- Please comment with `.take` on the issue. This lets others know you're working on it.
- While we don’t officially assign issues, commenting will inform the community of your intention to tackle the issue and help prevent duplicated efforts.

## 🤝 Asking for Help

If you're stuck or have questions:
- Don’t hesitate to ask for help in our [Slack](https://slack.com/invite/xxxxx) server or through GitHub Discussions.
- Engaging with the community can help resolve questions faster and provides an opportunity for collaborative problem-solving.

## 🔄 Linking Pull Requests to Issues

When you're ready to submit your work:
- Make sure to link your pull request to the issue it addresses. You can do this by including phrases like `Closes #issue_number` in your pull request description.
- This practice helps automate the closure of issues when pull requests are merged and keeps the project management process streamlined.

## 📊 Issue Triage

- Issues with a `triage` label are awaiting review by the project maintainers. Please refrain from starting work on these until they’ve been reviewed.

## 📚 Further Guidance

- **Label Reference**: Use our [Label Reference](https://github.com/openresearchcollabs/midFEMA/labels) to understand the types of issues and prioritize.
- **Self-Review Checklist**: Before submitting your issue or pull request, go through the [Self-Review Checklist](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/collaborating-on-github-docs/self-review-checklist) to ensure a smooth review process.
